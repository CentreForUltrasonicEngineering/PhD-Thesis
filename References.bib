DAX dramatically improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) allowing for easier visualization of anechoic cysts and blood vessels. This technique uses dual apodization or weighting strategies that are effective in removing or minimizing clutter and efficient in terms of computational load and hardware/software needs. This dual apodization allows us to determine the amount of mainlobe versus clutter contribution in a signal by cross-correlating RF data acquired from 2 apodization functions. Simulation results using a 128 element 5 MHz linear array show an improvement in CNR of 139\% compared with standard beamformed data with uniform apodization in a 3 mm diameter anechoic cylindrical cyst. Experimental CNR using a tissue-mimicking phantom with the same sized cyst shows an improvement of 123\% in a DAX processed image.},

In an alternative imaging mode, it shows one B-mode image rotating about the axis and its maximum intensity projection (MIP), processed at a rate of 104 fps.

	abstract = {Ultrasound imaging has become one of the most widely used modalities in medical diagnosis today. However, real-time ultrasound imaging requires large amount of data transfer and massive computation and therefore mainly relies on a complex dedicated hardware system. A recent trend of a graphics processing unit (GPU) based software-based approach offers the advantages of flexibility and quick implementation. The GPUs have been reported as excellent accelerators across a wide range of applications. For best exploiting outstanding computational power and high memory bandwidth of a GPU, the paper explores the design space of implementing an ultrasound beamformer on a GPU platform. The design spaces are expanded by applying different optimization strategies to the beamformer on a GPU platform, and we also discuss the performance evaluation results on the various GPUs whose architectural characteristics are different to each others. The performance analysis shows that by optimizing CUDA code, our real-time-GPU-based beamformer can be successfully implemented with 181 frames per second (fps) and speedup of 230.6X compared with the single-threaded implementation on a high-performance CPU platform.

	abstract = {In many ultrasound simulators for training purposes, synthetic ultrasound images have to be generated in real time. Patient specific anatomy can be modeled by using computed tomography (CT) data, and shadows can be calculated by using reflection coefficients and depth dependent, exponential attenuation. In order to include speckle, a pre-calculated texture map is typically added and blurred laterally to include an anisotropic point spread function (PSF). We propose to increase the speckle realism and allow for dynamic objects by using a physical model of the underlying scattering process. The scattering process is simulated as a convolution of the PSF of the ultrasound scanner with a scatterer distribution. The challenge is that the typical field-of-view (FOV) contains millions of scatterers which have to be selected by a virtual probe from an even larger body of scatterers. The main idea of this paper is to select and sample scatterers in parallel on the graphic processing unit (GPU). Ultrasound images of homogeneous tissue were produced in real time on a standard GPU (more than 10 frames per second). The ultrasound images were visually similar to images calculated by a reference method.},

	abstract = {The paper describes a class of adaptive weighting functions that greatly reduce sidelobes, interference, and noise in Fourier transform data. By restricting the class of adaptive weighting functions, the adaptively weighted Fourier transform data can be represented as the convolution of the unweighted Fourier transform with a data adaptive FIR filter where one selects the FIR filter coefficients to maximize signal-to-interference ratio. This adaptive sidelobe reduction (ASR) procedure is analogous to Capon's (1969) minimum variance method (MVM) of adaptive spectral estimation. Unlike MVM, which provides a statistical estimate of the real-valued power spectral density, thereby estimating noise level and improving resolution, ASR provides a single-realization complex-valued estimate of the Fourier transform that suppresses sidelobes and noise. Further, the computational complexity of ASR is dramatically lower than that of MVM, which is critical for large multidimensional problems such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation. ASR performance characteristics can be varied through the choice of filter order, l(1)- or l(2)-norm filter vector constraints and a separable or nonseparable multidimensional implementation. The author compares simulated point scattering SAR imagery produced by the ASR, MVM, and MUSIC algorithms and illustrates ASR performance on three sets of collected SAR imagery.},

It leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. This paper presents an adaptation of the Capon beamformer algorithm to ultrasound medical imaging with focused beams. The strategy is to apply data-dependent weight functions to the imaging aperture. These weights act as lateral spatial filters that filter out off-axis signals. The weights are computed for each point in the imaged medium, from the statistical analysis of the signals backscattered by that point to the different elements of the imaging probe when insonifying it with different focused beams. Phantom and in vivo images are presented to illustrate the benefits of the Capon algorithm over the conventional delay and-sum approach. On heart sector images, the clutter in the heart chambers is decreased. The endocardium border is better defined. On abdominal linear array images, significant contrast and resolution enhancement are observed.},

MV-adaptive beamformers can improve the image quality in terms of resolution and sidelobes by suppressing off-axis signals, while keeping onaxis ones. In addition, CF weighting can improve contrast and sidelobes by emphasizing the in-phase signals and reducing the out-of-phase ones. Combining MV and CF weighting results in simultaneous improvement of imaging resolution and contrast, outperforming both DAS and MV beamformers. In addition, because of the power of CF in reducing the focusing errors, the proposed method presents satisfactory robustness against sound velocity inhomogeneities, outperforming the regularized MV beamformer. The excellent performance of the proposed beamforming approach is demonstrated by several simulated examples.},

This improvement comes at the expense of an increased computational complexity. We have investigated the application of a beamspace adaptive beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging, which can be used to achieve reduced computational complexity with performance comparable to that of the Capon beamformer. The idea behind beamspace beamforming is that, instead of using the spatial statistics of the elements in the array to differentiate between signals and interference, we use the spatial statistics of a set of orthogonal beams, which are formed in different directions. This represents a shift from element space to beamspace. Because the majority of interference in medical ultrasound imaging is constrained to a limited spatial interval due to the focused transmit beam, this latter space can be reduced to a dimension that is lower than that of element space. We show, using simulations and experimental data, that this dimension can be selected as low as 3 while still achieving performance comparable to its element space counterpart.},

This method suffers from limitations, it needs the a priori knowledge of the geometry of the interface as well as the feature of the propagating medium. The TR method is based on the concept of time reversal of ultrasonic fields and takes into account the whole information coming from the sample. This technique is self adaptive and only requires the presence of a target in the solid sample, In this paper, we are interested in focusing an acoustic pressure field through a plane interface separating a liquid and a solid.

	abstract = {Sound-velocity inhomogeneities degrade both spatial and contrast resolutions. This paper proposes a new adaptive imaging technique that uses the generalized coherence factor (GCF) to reduce the focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. The GCF is derived from the spatial spectrum of the received aperture data after proper receive delays have been applied. It is defined as the ratio of the spectral energy within a prespecified low-frequency range to the total energy. It is demonstrated that the low-frequency component of the spectrum corresponds to the coherent portion of the received data, and that the high-frequency component corresponds to the incoherent portion. Hence, the GCF reduces to the coherence factor defined in the literature if the prespecified low-frequency range is restricted to dc only. In addition, the GCF is also an index of the focusing quality and can be used as a weighting factor for the reconstructed image. The efficacy of the GCF technique is demonstrated for focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. Simulations and real ultrasound data are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed GCF technique. The characteristics of the GCF, including the effects of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channels, are also discussed. The GCF technique also is compared with the correlation-based technique and the parallel adaptive receive compensation algorithm; the improvement in image quality obtained with the proposed technique rivals that of the latter technique. In the presence of a displaced phase screen, this proposed technique also outperforms the correlation-based technique. Computational complexity and implementation issues also are addressed.},

Implementation of the SCF technique is quite straightforward, operating in realtime, and can be added to any virtually existing beamformer to improve the resolution, contrast, SNR, and dynamic range of the images. A programmable parameter allows adjusting the sensitivity of the method to out-of-phase signals, from zero to a strict coherence criterion.

The technique weights the output of a conventional beamformer with a coherence factor obtained from the aperture data phase dispersion. It can be simply implemented in real-time and it operates automatically, without needing any parameter adjustment. This paper presents the theoretical basis of phase coherence imaging to reduce grain noise, as well as experimental results that confirm the expected performance.},

Recently, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative technology offering advantages such as wide bandwidth, ease of fabricating large arrays, and potential for integration with electronics. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the viability of CMUTs for ultrasound imaging. We present the first pulse-echo phased array B-scan sector images using a 128-element, one-dimensional (1-D) linear CMUT array. We fabricated 64- and 128-element 1-D CMUT arrays with 100\% yield and uniform element response across the arrays. These arrays have been operated in immersion with no failure or degradation in performance over the time. For imaging experiments, we built a resolution test phantom roughly mimicking the attenuation properties of soft tissue. We used a PC-based experimental system, including custom-designed electronic circuits to acquire the complete set of 128/spl times/128 RF A-scans from all transmit-receive element combinations. We obtained the pulse-echo frequency response by analyzing the echo signals from wire targets. These echo signals presented an 80\% fractional bandwidth around 3 MHz, including the effect of attenuation in the propagating medium. We reconstructed the B-scan images with a sector angle of 90 degrees and an image depth of 210 mm through offline processing by using RF beamforming and synthetic phased array approaches. The measured 6-dB lateral and axial resolutions at 135 mm depth were 0.0144 radians and 0.3 mm, respectively. The electronic noise floor of the image was more than 50 dB below the maximum mainlobe magnitude. We also performed preliminary investigations on the effects of crosstalk among array elements on the image quality. In the near field, some artifacts were observable extending out from the array to a depth of 2 cm. A tail also was observed in the point spread function (PSF) in the axial direction, indicating the - - existence of crosstalk. The relative amplitude of this tail with respect to the mainlobe was less than -20 dB.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic transducer arrays are extensively used for the nondestructive evaluation of materials for aerospace and other applications. However, their use with composites requires some technique development because of reflections at the layer boundaries and the effects of attenuation. When used in full matrix capture mode, algorithms such as the total focusing method (TFM) must be applied to obtain the image. In composite materials, improvement to the algorithm is required to include the effects of material anisotropy (affecting wave speed) and optimum aperture limits to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio and location detection for a defect in the material. This paper presents simulations of the ultrasonic array signals in multilayer anisotropic materials with and without a simulated defect. A kernel model for plane wave propagation in the material is combined with an angular spectrum decomposition (for finite transducer elements) and transducer frequency response, to model the full array signals. Inclusion of the defect is through its far-field scattering response. The model facilitates the study of imaging algorithm development by identification of the effects of anisotropy, signal-to-noise ratio, and aperture limit. An analytical method for the calculation of the effective group velocity in the composite at low frequency is demonstrated, permitting rapid calculation of time delay laws in practice.},

	abstract = {The design of aperture weightings in ultrasound arrays is a multi-objective optimization problem, involving parameters such as delays, aperture size, focal depth, operating frequency and beam properties. Besides, apodization causes the SNR in array output to be decreased. We introduce an analytic expression of the lateral point spread function and a model for SNR as nonlinear functions of weights, based on which, a new aperture design method is established, resulting in an optimal set of weights. These weights provide a point spread function having the predetermined peak sidelobe level, while the SNR in array output is optimized. Optimization results from a linear array with M=128 elements equally spaced at one wavelength, center frequency f0=3.5 MHz and 50\% relative bandwidth, have shown that decreasing the peak sidelobe level, decreases the SNR. Therefore, an array designer can select a proper set of weights according to its application, using a SNR curve versus to the peak sidelobe level. In addition, the method can maintain the same beam properties over a long range with low variations in the SNR. Simulation results have shown only 1 dB variations in the SNR for depths from 20 mm to 120 mm, which is a longer range and better SNR performance than the conventional methods.},

In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence-factor (CF) weighting and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) method. The CF is an index of focusing quality estimated from receive-channel data in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF so as to reduce the unwanted sidelobes. Direct implementation of CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because the broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging reduce the accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we alleviated this problem by applying the MVDR method. We test the proposed method with the synthetic transmit aperture method where only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data were used, and the proposed method enhanced the mean contrast by around 4.6 dB and the mean contrast-to-noise ratio by around 20\%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at improving the image quality.},

The inspection of these components using 2-D ultrasonic arrays potentially allows the detection of subsurface defects in three-dimensions from one inspection location.

In this paper, a model of wave propagation in anisotropic material is used to correct an ultrasonic imaging algorithm and is applied to a single-crystal test specimen. For this corrected-algorithm, the orientation of the crystal in a specimen must be known before the inspection. Using the same ultrasonic array to measure the orientation and perform the defect inspection offers the most practical solution. Therefore, potential crystallographic orientation methods using 2-D ultrasonic arrays are also developed and evaluated.},

Focusing Technique (SAFT) are: (i) a large divergence of the sound beam
of the transducer and (ii) an exact knowledge about the sound

sources directly mounted on the surface of the specimen. In many cases,
however, the transducer is wedge mounted and/or coupled using a water
delay line, e.g. in immersion technique. These delay lines change the
beam index and the propagation path has to be evaluated for each pixel
separately considering Fermat's principle. Using phased array
transducers, a sector scan can improve the divergence of the sound beam.
The introduced method combines the advantages of using a phased array
transducer in immersion technique to improve SAFT reconstruction. An
algorithm is presented accounting the influence of the delay line on the
reconstruction method. The applicability of the algorithm is shown by
validation with simulated echo responses and with experimental results

The process is easy but takes a long time. This work presents a new technique to compute the focusing delays for an equivalent virtual array that operates in the second medium only, thus avoiding any interface. It is nearly as fast as computing the focal laws in the homogeneous case and an order of magnitude faster than Snell\&apos;s or Fermat\&apos;s principle based methods. Furthermore, the technique is completely general and can be applied to any equipment having dynamic focusing capabilities. In fact, the technique is especially well suited for real-time focal law computing hardware.},

In this paper a general imaging methodology, termed multi-mode total focusing method, is proposed in which any combination of modes and reflections can be used to produce an image of the test structure. Like the total focusing method, this approach is implemented by post-processing the full matrix of array data to achieve a synthetic focus at every pixel in the image. A hybrid model is used to predict the array data and demonstrate the performance of the multi-mode imaging concept. This hybrid model combines far field scattering coefficient matrices with a ray-based wave propagation model. This allows the inclusion of longitudinal waves, shear waves and wave mode conversions. It is shown that, with prior knowledge of likely scatterer location and orientation, the mode combination and array location can be optimised to maximise the performance of array inspections. A practically relevant weld inspection application is then described and its optimisation is discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a technique for improving the internal imaging of a solid object immersed in water using an ultrasonic array. This technique consists in determining the position and shape of a convex object surface using a combination of synthetic transmit aperture (STA) and sign coherence factor (SCF) methods. The SCF attenuates the grating lobe noise. The technique is applied to a cylindrical aluminium object with internal holes simulating defects. The first step is the acquisition of a sequence of STA images with SCF, using a distinct group of adjacent array elements for each image. In the second step, a circle is fitted to the positions of the peak values in each image. Finally, using the Fermat\&apos;s principle and this circle as the interface between the water and the metallic object, the propagation delays from the array elements to the image grid points may be calculated and used in another STA image. In this final image, the small holes in the cylindrical object can clearly be identified. The effects of the SCF for a large diameter circular reflector are simulated and compared with experimental data.},

These unique and highly interdisciplinary series of symposiums have met at intervals of roughly 18 months over the past 30 some years. In general these meetings are devoted to all aspects and all fields of imaging that use acoustics. The meetings are usually small, with 100 to 200 participants, and stimulate useful interchanges across disciplines. These are the only regular meetings where the major researchers in all areas of acoustical imaging can come together to interchange ideas and new concepts. The Acoustical Imaging Symposiums have long been regarded as the premier meeting of this type in the general field of acoustics. The highly regarded and carefully edited proceedings have been published regularly by Plenum Press. I am proud and honored to serve as editor of the 21st volume in this series. The 21st Symposium was attended by well over 100 participants from some 18 countries. During the three day symposium, 94 scientific presentations were given, 66 as formal lectures and 28 in a poster format. Sufficient time was available during the conference, both following the presentations and informally during meals and breaks, for active discussions among all participants. Over 80 of the presentations have been selected for inclusion in these proceedings.},

Among the mathematical features of CASs there are transformations allowing one to optimize the final code instructions. In this paper we show some kind of optimizations that can be done on new or existing algorithms, by extending some techniques that compilers apply currently to optimize the machine code. The results show that the CPU time taken by the optimized code is reduced by a factor that can reach 5. The optimizations are performed with a package built on a well known CAS: Mathematica.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic C-scanning is widely used for large-area flaw detection but acquiring the full RF waveform for each surface point – Full Waveform Capture (FWC) – offers many advantages. A system that used phased arrays to achieve this without loss of area coverage rate has been reported(1). FWC allows many signal processing operations, previously only possible at acquisition, to be performed off-line. Multiple or time-consuming algorithms can be performed on the same data set without compromising inspection speed but some, such as steering and focusing, must still be performed at acquisition.Although ultrasonic arrays are now widely accepted in imaging systems, their full capability will only be realised when viewed as distributed data collection devices(2). The modular array hardware of DSL’s ‘FlawInspecta’ can now achieve this at real-time rates, significantly extending the post-processing operations that can be performed. These include steering and focusing adjustments, data-dependent adaptive focusing, and multi-array data collection and processing. A flexible data formatting has been devised to provide an interface for end-users to develop customised algorithms.The paper reports on the distributed data acquisition architecture and the data storage format. Specific post processing operations are covered elsewhere(3) but some typical options will be outlined.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic array inspection of a component with a nonplanar surface can be achieved in immersion using a liquid layer to couple ultrasonic waves from an array probe into a solid structure. This paper presents an efficient way to compute the appropriate element time delays in immersion without compromising the measurement accuracy. In the proposed imaging process, the surface geometry is first measured ultrasonically by forming an image of the component surface in the couplant. This leads to a set of discrete points that define the surface profile of the component. The propagation time from an array element to a point in the component is then determined by a grid search of candidate ray-paths through each surface point to identify the one that yields the shortest traveling time. Propagation times in the component are first generated on a coarse mesh of points and then these values are linearly interpolated to find the propagation time to each image pixel. The computed propagation times are finally used to reconstruct an image of the component interior. An analytical model is developed to determine a relationship between estimated propagation time errors and their effect on the array inspection in terms of signal amplitude from a reflector. For nominally normal incidence inspection of a metallic component with a minimum surface radius of 30 wavelengths immersed in water, it is found that the surface of the component can be adequately described by points spaced by one wavelength and that delays can be computed on a coarse grid of points spaced at 3 wavelengths. With these parameters, the reduction in amplitude of a point target in the component is shown to be less than 1 dB.},

This paper discusses the selection of the appropriate mode and frequency range for different inspection requirements and reviews the possible methods of excitation, response measurement and signal processing. It is usually desirable to transmit a single, non-dispersive mode, and excitation methods to achieve this are discussed. A variety of signal processing techniques from simple time domain to relatively complex two-dimensional Fourier analysis are available. Time domain processing can often be applied satisfactorily in low frequency-thickness regions where only two modes can propagate, but tends to be unreliable above the cut-off frequency of the a1 mode. As an example of the design of a Lamb wave testing regime, a set of tests on a butt-welded steel plate with simulated weld defects of different depths is described. It is shown that by operating below the a1 cut-off frequency with judicious selection of testing technique, the presence of defects can be detected reliably from changes in the shape of the received waveform.},

	abstract = {Background: A new commercially available device (IOLMaster, Zeiss Instruments) provides high resolution non-contact measurements of axial length (using partial coherent interferometry), anterior chamber depth, and corneal radius (using image analysis). The study evaluates the validity and repeatability of these measurements and compares the findings with those obtained from instrumentation currently used in clinical practice.
Method: Measurements were taken on 52 subjects (104 eyes) aged 18–40 years with a range of mean spherical refractive error from +7.0 D to −9.50 D. IOLMaster measurements of anterior chamber depth and axial length were compared with A-scan applanation ultrasonography (Storz Omega) and those for corneal radius with a Javal-Schiötz keratometer (Topcon) and an EyeSys corneal videokeratoscope.
Results: Axial length: the difference between IOLMaster and ultrasound measures was insignificant (0.02 (SD 0.32) mm, p = 0.47) with no bias across the range sampled (22.40–27.99 mm). Anterior chamber depth: significantly shorter depths than ultrasound were found with the IOLMaster (−0.06 (0.25) mm, p {\textless}0.02) with no bias across the range sampled (2.85–4.40 mm). Corneal radius: IOLMaster measurements matched more closely those of the keratometer than those of the videokeratoscope (mean difference −0.03 v −0.06 mm respectively), but were more variable (95\% confidence 0.13 v 0.07 mm). The repeatability of all the above IOLMaster biometric measures was found to be of a high order with no significant bias across the measurement ranges sampled.
Conclusions: The validity and repeatability of measurements provided by the IOLMaster will augment future studies in ocular biometry.},

	abstract = {Improving the ultrasound inspection capability for coarse-grained metals remains of longstanding interest and is expected to become increasingly important for next-generation electricity power plants. Conventional ultrasonic A-, B-, and C-scans have been found to suffer from strong background noise caused by grain scattering, which can severely limit the detection of defects. However, in recent years, array probes and full matrix capture (FMC) imaging algorithms have unlocked exciting possibilities for improvements. To improve and compare these algorithms, we must rely on robust methodologies to quantify their performance. This article proposes such a methodology to evaluate the detection performance of imaging algorithms. For illustration, the methodology is applied to some example data using three FMC imaging algorithms; total focusing method (TFM), phase-coherent imaging (PCI), and decomposition of the time-reversal operator with multiple scattering filter (DORT MSF). However, it is important to note that this is solely to illustrate the methodology; this article does not attempt the broader investigation of different cases that would be needed to compare the performance of these algorithms in general. The methodology considers the statistics of detection, presenting the detection performance as probability of detection (POD) and probability of false alarm (PFA). A test sample of coarse-grained nickel super alloy, manufactured to represent materials used for future power plant components and containing some simple artificial defects, is used to illustrate the method on the candidate algorithms. The data are captured in pulse-echo mode using 64-element array probes at center frequencies of 1 and 5 MHz. In this particular case, it turns out that all three algorithms are shown to perform very similarly when comparing their flaw detection capabilities.},

The high performance, data-parallel architecture of modern graphical processing units (GPUs) can reduce computational times by orders of magnitude. However, its massively threaded architecture introduces challenges when GPU resources are exceeded. This paper presents optimization strategies for compute- and memory-bound algorithms for the CUDA architecture. For compute-bound algorithms, the registers are reduced through variable reuse via shared memory and the data throughput is increased through heavier thread workloads and maximizing the thread configuration for a single thread block per multiprocessor. For memory-bound algorithms, fitting the data into the fast but limited GPU resources is achieved through reorganizing the data into self-contained structures and employing a multi-pass approach. Memory latencies are reduced by selecting memory resources whose cache performance are optimized for the algorithm's access patterns. We demonstrate the strategies on two computationally expensive algorithms and achieve optimized GPU implementations that perform up to 6× faster than unoptimized ones. Compared to CPU implementations, we achieve peak GPU speedups of 129× for the 3D unbiased nonlinear image registration technique and 93× for the non-local means surface denoising algorithm.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic arrays are increasingly widely used in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) due to their greater flexibility and potentially superior performance compared to conventional monolithic probes. The characterization of small defects remains a challenge for NDE and is of great importance for determining the impact of a defect on the integrity of a structure. In this paper, a technique for characterizing reflectors with subwavelength dimensions is described. This is achieved by post-processing the complete data set of time traces obtained from an ultrasonic array using two algorithms. The first algorithm is used to obtain information about reflector orientation and the second algorithm is used to distinguish between point-like reflectors that reflect uniformly in all directions and specular reflectors that have distinct orientations. Experimental results are presented using a commercial 64-element, 5-MHZ array on two aluminum test specimens that contain a number of machined slots and side-drilled holes. The results show that the orientation of 1-mm-long slots can be determined to within a few degrees and that the signals from 1-mm-long slots can be distinguished from that from a 1-mm-diameter circular hole. Techniques for quantifying both the orientation and the specularity of measured signals are presented and the effect of processing parameters on the accuracy of results is discussed.},

Unfortunately, strong attenuation and scattering impede guided waves for large-area inspection. Nevertheless, small, low-cost and light-weight piezoelectric (PZT) discs were bonded to various parts of the aircraft wing, in a form of relatively sparse arrays, for simulated cracks and corrosion monitoring. The PZT discs take turns generating and receiving ultrasonic guided waves. Pair-wise through-transmission waveforms collected at normal conditions served as baselines, and subsequent signals collected at defected conditions such as rivet cracks or corrosion detected the presence of a defect and its location with a novel correlation analysis based technique called RAPID (reconstruction algorithm for probabilistic inspection of defects). The effectiveness of the algorithm was tested with several case studies in a laboratory environment. It showed good performance for defect detection, size estimation and localization in complex aircraft wing structures.},

The 9\% chromium steels developed during the last three decades are of great interest in such applications. In this report, the development of steels P91, P92 and E911 is described. It is shown that the martensitic transformation in these three steels produces high dislocation density that confers significant transient hardening. However, the dislocation density decreases during exposure at service temperatures due to recovery effects and for long-term creep strength the sub-grain structure produced under different conditions is most important. The changes in the microstructure mean that great care is needed in the extrapolation of experimental data to obtain design values. Only data from tests with rupture times above 3,000 h provide reasonable extrapolated values. It is further shown that for the 9\% chromium steels, oxidation resistance in steam is not sufficiently high for their use as thin-walled components at temperatures of 600°C and above. The potential for the development of steels of higher chromium contents (above 11\%) to give an improvement in steam oxidation resistance whilst maintaining creep resistance to the 9\% chromium steels is discussed.},

Lewandowski, Sound fields for coded excitations in water and tissue: experimental approach, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 33 (4) (2007) 601-607], which examined the factors influencing the spatial resolution of coded complementary Golay sequences (CGS), this paper investigates the effect of ultrasound imaging transducer's fractional bandwidth on the gain of the compressed echo signal for different spectral widths of the CGS. Two different bit lengths were considered, specifically one and two cycles. Three transducers having fractional bandwidth of 25\%, 58\% and 80\% and operating at frequencies 6, 4.4 and 6 MHz, respectively were examined (one of the 6 MHz sources was focused and made of composite material). The experimental results have shown that by increasing the code length, i.e. decreasing the bandwidth, the compressed echo amplitude could be enhanced. The smaller the bandwidth was the larger was the gain; the pulse-echo sensitivity of the echo amplitude increased by 1.88, 1.62 and 1.47, for 25\%, 58\% and 80\% bandwidths, respectively. These results indicate that two cycles bit length excitation is more suitable for use with bandwidth limited commercially available imaging transducers. Further, the time resolution is retained for transducers with two cycles excitation providing the fractional bandwidth is lower than approximately 90\%. The results of this work also show that adjusting the code length allows signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) to be enhanced while using limited (less that 80\%) bandwidth imaging transducers. Also, for such bandwidth limited transducers two cycles excitation would not decrease the time resolution, obtained with "conventional" spike excitation. Hence, CGS excitation could be successfully implemented with the existing, relatively narrow band imaging transducers without the need to use usually more expensive wideband, composite ones.},

This IGCC case is based on an oxygen blown entrained flow gasifier operating at 27 bar, the removal of acid gas (H2S) is performed with MDEA unit, the efficiency of this IGCC is 43\% based on the low heating value (LHV) of coal. A carbon dioxide separation unit conveniently integrated in a pre-combustion separation process is chosen, in order to take advantage of the high pressure of the gas. The methanol process for carbon dioxide removal is integrated downstream the existing desulfuration unit, and after a CO shift conversion unit. In this study, the integration of the CO2 capture process to the IGCC is simulated as realistically as possible. The design parameters of both the gas turbine (the turbine inlet temperature, compressor pressure ratio, reduced flow rate) and the steam turbine (Stodola parameter) are taken into account. Maintenance of low NO x production in the combustion chamber is also considered. The production of NO x is supposed to be influenced by the low heating value of the gas which is maintained as low as for case of the synthesis gas without CO2 capture. Thus the choice is made to feed the gas turbine of the combined cycle with a diluted synthesis gas, having similar low heating value than the one produced without the CO2 capture. Plant performances for different conversion and capture rates are compared. A final optimized integration is given for 92 mol\% CO conversion rate and 95 mol\% CO2 absorption rates, a comparison with former studies is proposed.},

The technique utilizes on-off RF switches which are programmed in a predetermined sequence to produce the desired pattern. The results of tests on an experimental eight-element slot array designed for sidelobe reduction are presented. Two examples are considered: 1) an initial static pattern with 30-db sidelobes which are reduced to about 40 db by sequential switching and 2) an initial static pattern with 13-db sidelobes which are reduced directly to about 40 db by a different sequence of switching. Measured patterns illustrating the sidelobe reduction are included. The applicability of the sidelobe reduction technique to large electronically steerable phased arrays is considered briefly and it is concluded that it is compatible with such systems.},

Isothermal heat treatments were carried out to study the thermal stability of the methanol milled and cryomilled powders, as well as the HVOF-derived coatings. All nanocrystalline Inconel 718 powders and coatings studied herein exhibited significant thermal stability against grain growth by maintaining a grain size around 100 nm following annealing at 1273 K for 60 min. In the case of the cryomilled nanocrystalline Ni powders, isothermal grain growth behavior was studied, from which the parameters required for the prediction of the microstructural evolution during a non-isothermal annealing were acquired. The theoretical simulation of grain growth behavior of nanocrystalline Ni during non-isothermal annealing conditions yields results that are in good agreement with the experimental results.},

The algorithms are tested with simulated and experimental array data, each containing different noise levels. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in terms of lateral resolution and sensitivity to noise. It is shown that for the weak noise situation (SNR \&gt; 20 dB), time-reversal MUSIC provides significantly enhanced lateral resolution when compared to the total focusing method, breaking the diffraction limit. However, for higher noise levels, the total focusing method is shown to be robust, whilst the performance of time-reversal MUSIC is degraded. The influence of multiple scattering on the imaging algorithms is also investigated and shown to be small.},

Research to increase both has been pursued worldwide, since the energy crisis in the 1970s. The need to reduce CO2 emissions has recently provided an additional incentive to increase efficiency. More recently, interest has been evinced in advanced combustion technologies utilizing oxygen instead of air for combustion. The main enabling technology in achieving the above goals is the development of stronger high temperature materials. Extensive research-and-development programs have resulted in numerous high-strength alloys for heavy section piping and for tubing needed to build boilers. The study reported on here is aimed at identifying, evaluating, and qualifying the materials needed for the construction of the critical components of coal-fired boilers that are capable of operating with steam at temperatures of 760 °C (1400 °F) and pressures of 35 MPa (5000 psi). The economic viability of such a plant has been explored. Candidate alloys applicable to various ranges of temperatures have been identified. Stress rupture tests have been completed on the base metal and on welds to a number of alloys. Steamside oxidation tests in an autoclave at 650 °C (1200 °F) and 800 °C (1475 °F) have been completed. Fireside corrosion tests have been conducted under conditions simulating those of waterwalls and superheater/reheater tubes. The weldability and fabricability of the alloys have been investigated. The capabilities of various overlay coatings and diffusion coatings have been examined. This article provides a status report on the progress achieved to date on this project.},

	abstract = {An ultrasonic array is a single transducer that contains a number of individually connected elements. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of ultrasonic arrays for non-destructive evaluation. Arrays offer great potential to increase inspection quality and reduce inspection time. Their main advantages are their increased flexibility over traditional single element transducer methods, meaning that one array can be used to perform a number of different inspections, and their ability to produce immediate images of the test structure. These advantages have led to the rapid uptake of arrays by the engineering industry. These industrial applications are underpinned by a wide range of published research which describes new piezoelectric materials, array geometries, modelling methods and inspection modalities. The aim of this paper is to bring together the most relevant published work on arrays for non-destructive evaluation applications, comment on the state-of the art and discuss future directions. There is also a significant body of published literature referring to use of arrays in the medical and sonar fields and the most relevant papers from these related areas are also reviewed. However, although there is much common ground, the use of arrays in non-destructive evaluation offers some distinctly different challenges to these other disciplines.},

The role of creep, fatigue and oxidation in crack growth has been investigated at 650°C under typical loading waveforms at selected loading frequencies. Load-line deflections were monitored in selected tests under static and long dwell loading conditions. Scanning electron microscopy was adopted to identify the fracture mode and to facilitate the evaluation of oxidation.

The results show that mixed time and cycle dependent crack growth seems to be the predominant crack growth mode in the two PM nickel alloys studied. Whilst limited creep may be present at the crack tip, particularly under static and long dwell loading conditions, oxidation appears to be the predominant mechanism for crack growth under the test conditions examined.},

Research to increase both has been pursued worldwide, since the energy crisis in the 1970s. The need to reduce CO2 emission has recently provided an additional incentive to increase efficiency. Thus, steam temperatures of the most efficient fossil power plants are now in the 600 °C (1112 °F) range, which represents an increase of about 60 °C (108 °F) in 30 years. It is expected that steam temperatures will rise another 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) in the next 30 years. The main enabling technology is the development of stronger high-temperature materials, capable of operating under high stresses at ever-increasing temperatures. Recently, the EPRI performed a state-of-the-art review of materials technology for advanced boiler/steam turbine power plants (ultrasupercritical power plants). The results of the review show that with respect to boilers, high-strength ferritic 9–12Cr steels for use in thick section components are now commercially available for temperatures up to 620 °C (1150 °F). Initial data on two experimental 12Cr ferritic steels indicate that they may be capable of long-term service up to 650 °C (1112 °F), but more data are required to confirm this. For higher temperatures, austenitic steels and Ni-based alloys are needed. Advanced austenitic stainless steels for use as super and reheater tubing are available for service temperatures up to 650 °C (1112 °F) and possibly 700 °C (1292 °F). Ni-based superalloys would be needed for higher temperatures. None of these steels have been approved by the ASME Boiler Code Group so far. Higher-strength materials are needed for upper water walls of boilers with steam pressure above 24 MPa (3400 psi). A high-strength 2-1/2\%Cr steel recently ASME code approved as T-23 is the preferred candidate material for this application. Field trials are in progress. This paper will present the results of the EPRI review in detail, relating to boiler material. Results relating to turbine materials are presented in a companion paper as Part 2.},

It is concluded that for utilities, refurbishment represents a useful increase in the range of generating options open to them. The impact on the heavy electrical industry is likely to be less favourable, leading to a need for reductions in capacity and a continuation of the trend towards mergers and international collaborations that has been a feature of the past 20 yr.},

Using the Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM), the extent of grain boundary chromium depletion is quantitatively determined as a function of thermal treatment time at 700 °C following a 30 min solution anneal at 1100 °C. Results confirm the presence of grain boundary chromium depletion that varies in extent with time at temperature, the chromium concentration falling to values as low as 3 wt pct. The chromium depletion volume is characterized by a depletion parameter which is correlated with intergranular corrosion test results to determine a self-healing (desensitization) chromium concentration of 9 wt pct. Trace element segregation at grain boundaries is measured by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) as a function of aging treatment. Results show that after thermally treating samples for various times at 700 °C, phosphorus is always present at the grain boundaries. Intergranular corrosion behavior as a function of thermal treatment appears to be governed more strongly by chromium depletion than trace element segregation.},

	abstract = {The efficiency of conventional fossil power plants is a strong function of the steam temperature and pressure. Research to increase both has been pursued worldwide, since the energy crisis in the 1970s. The need to reduce CO2 emission has recently provided an additional incentive to increase efficiency. The main enabling technology in achieving the above goals has been the development of stronger high-temperature materials. Extensive R\&amp;D programs have resulted in numerous high strength alloys for heavy section piping, and tubing needed to build boilers. The study reported here is aimed at identifying, evaluating and qualifying the materials needed for the construction of the critical components of coal-fired boilers capable of operating with 760 °C (1400 °F)/35 MPa (5000 psi) steam. The economic viability of such a plant has been explored. Candidate alloys applicable to various ranges of temperature have been identified. Stress rupture tests have been completed on the base metal and on welds to a number of alloys. Steamside oxidation tests in an autoclave at 650 (1200 °F) and 800 °C (1475 °F) have been completed. Fireside corrosion tests have been conducted under conditions simulating those of waterwalls and superheater/reheater tubes. Weldability and fabricability of the alloys have been investigated. The capability of various overlay coatings and diffusion coatings have been examined. This paper provides a status report on the progress achieved to date on this project.},

Quantitative microstructural analyses using TEM of thin foils and extraction double replicas have been carried out after different austenitization and tempering treatments and after creep deformation at 600 and 650°C. Statistical quantitative analyses were undertaken to determine the dislocation density within the martensite laths, the width of the martensite laths/subgrains and the size and distribution of the carbide and carbonitride precipitates. Correlation of the results of the microstructural investigation with the creep rupture properties allowed the stability of the microstructure during the high temperature exposure to be assessed. The consequences of microstructural changes for the extrapolation of creep rupture data to design lifetimes are considered. Taking into account the strengthening mechanisms which remain effective in long term testing, the 100000 h stress rupture strength of P92 at 600°C is estimated at 115 MPa.},

Depending on operating conditions, some of the designs favor the use of elevated-temperature ferritic/martensitic steels for in-core and out-of core applications. This class of commercial steels has been investigated in previous work on international fast reactor and fusion reactor research programs. More recently, international fusion reactor research programs have developed and tested elevated-temperature reduced-activation steels. Steels from these fission and fusion programs will provide reference materials for future fission applications. In addition, new elevated-temperature steels have been developed in recent years for conventional power systems that also need to be considered for the next generation of nuclear reactors.},

	abstract = {Creep cracking tests were performed on a nickel base superalloy, Inconel 718, using CT type specimens at 650°C in an air environment. Both time to initiate creep crack propagation (T1) and creep crack growth rate (ȧ) were measured as a function of the stress-intensity factor, K. It is shown that crack initiation behaviour and early crack growth (stage I) are strongly dependent on test procedures. Furthermore there is no unique correlation between ȧ and K, except in the regime corresponding to relatively high crack growth rates (stage II). This conclusion was reached by conducting tests both under increasing and under decreasing K. The reasons for this behaviour are briefly discussed in relation to environmental effects. A simple model (based upon a theoretical stress-strain field for creeping cracked solids and the ductility exhaustion concept) is used in an attempt to explain the results. The limitations for the application of this model are discussed. It is shown that this approach can explain a number of experimental results provided that it is accepted that creep ductility is time-dependent because of environmental effects. Finally, the results of these crack propagation tests are used in conjunction with the theoretical results derived from the Riedel and Rice analysis to model both crack initiation and crack growth behaviour of Inconel 718 under sustained load.},

	abstract = {During the last fifty years steam pressure and temperature in fossil-fired power plants have been continuously raised to improve thermal efficiency. Recent efforts for raising steam conditions are in response to the social demand for environmental protection as well as energy conservation concerns. Today the steam temperature of 600°C for modern power plants equipped with swing load or sliding pressure demand functions has already been realized, and a goal for the future is the 630°C to 650°C class with ferritic steels.However the 600°C to 630°C class is possible for current construction, based on already developed materials that include ferritic steels for pipework and rotors. Numerous studies on heat resistant steels actively conducted since the early 1970s have allowed great progress in both 9–12\% Cr steels and austenitic steels. This paper presents a historical view of developments in steam pressure and temperature of fossil-fired power plants and alloy design for heat resistant steels in the 20th century, particularly over the last severaldecades, as well as a survey of the current status of steel development for power plants, mainly with regard to creep strengthening and enhancement of corrosion resistance.},

Due to the presence of speckle, which can be modeled as a strong, multiplicative noise, edge detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is extremely difficult, and edge detectors developed for optical images are inefficient. Several robust operators have been developed for the detection of isolated step edges in speckled images. The authors propose a new step-edge detector for SAR images, which is optimal in the minimum mean square error (MSSE) sense under a stochastic multiedge model. It computes a normalized ratio of exponentially weighted averages (ROEWA) on opposite sides of the central pixel. This is done in the horizontal and vertical direction, and the magnitude of the two components yields an edge strength map. Thresholding of the edge strength map by a modified version of the watershed algorithm and region merging to eliminate false edges complete an efficient segmentation scheme. Experimental results obtained from simulated SAR images as well as ERS-1 data are presented},

While long wavelengths can penetrate deep into a medium, the resolution limit precludes the possibility of observing subwavelength structures. Near-field microscopy has recently demonstrated that the resolution limit can be overcome by bringing a probing sensor within one wavelength distance from the surface to be imaged. This paper extends the scope of near-field microscopy to the reconstruction of subwavelength structures from measurements performed in the far-field. It is shown that the distortion undergone by a wave field as it travels through an inhomogeneous medium and the subsequent generation of local evanescent fields encode subwavelength information in the far-field due to multiple scattering within the medium. This argument is proved theoretically and supported by a limited view experiment performed with elastic waves in which an image with a resolution better than a third of the wavelength is achieved.},

	abstract = {In this paper the theory of wave propagation in continuous- inhomogeneous media is utilized to explain scattering of ultrasound by soft tissues. When a number of scattering volume elements are present, as opposed to one, the scattered energy from a given volume element subsequently encounters other scattering volume elements. As a result of this, the sound energy is diffused instead of being propagated as well-defined waves. This means that the phase relationships are lost and the radiation becomes incoherent somewhat in the fashion described by Foldy15. If one were to freeze the ensemble to one instant and observe all the volume elements, each of them would appear as a secondary source emitting radiation in a different phase. Using this concept and assuming that soft tissues do not possess any sharp discontinuities, an equation for attenuation due to scattering is obtained which predicts a near linear frequency dependence for scattering-attenuation. The velocity fluctuations and correlation length for a variety of tissues are estimated from the values of scattering-attenuation using the postulated model. On the basis of these values, ray, Born, and Rytov approximations used to describe sound propagation through soft tissues, are evaluated.},

	abstract = {Work is being conducted to develop ultrasonic phased array inspection of stainless steel welded pipes with a completely undressed weld cap. The benefit of phased array inspection over single-crystal inspections is the ability to fire the array elements in a particular sequence (often termed a delay law) to steer and focus the beam, which allows multiple inspections to be conducted with a single transducer. Using a collection of different delay laws, conventional phased array controller software can generate a number of different types of image, such as plane and focused B-scan images as well as sector-scan images. When conducting an inspection we have chosen to collect the full matrix capture (FMC) of data, which involves the collection of the transmit-receive time domain signals from all element combinations, and post-process the data to form an image. The advantage of FMC is that it allows multiple inspections to be obtained from a single dataset, removes the dependence on phased array controller software for the processing of data and display of results, and allows more advanced processing algorithms that could not be applied to conventional data capture. This can improve the detection and characterisation of defects and hence improve safety; it also future-proofs inspection data, which can be archived and processed at a later date. This paper explains the FMC principle and describes the signal processing algorithms. The inspections were modelled using the CEA CIVA software and compared to experimental results.},

Periodically corrugated waveguides are gaining popularity in the field of vibration control and for designing structures with desired acoustic band gaps. Currently only numerical method (Boundary Element Method or Finite Element Method) based packages (e.g., PZFlex) are in principle capable of modeling ultrasonic fields in complex structures with rapid change of curvatures at the interfaces and boundaries but no analyses have been reported. However, the packages are very CPU intensive; it requires a huge amount of computation memory and time for its execution. In this paper a new semi-analytical technique called Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) is used to model the ultrasonic field in sinusoidally corrugated waveguides immersed in water where the interface curvature changes rapidly. DPSM results are compared with analytical solutions. It is found that when a narrow ultrasonic beam hits the corrugation peaks at an angle, the wave propagates in the backward direction in waveguides with high corrugation depth. However, in waveguides with small corrugation the wave propagates in the forward direction. The forward and backward propagation phenomenon is found to be independent of the signal frequency and depends on the degree of corrugation. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract = {Advances in manufacturing techniques and materials have led to an increase in the demand for reliable and robust inspection techniques to maintain safety critical features. The application of modelling methods to develop and evaluate inspections is becoming an essential tool for the NDE community. Current analytical methods are inadequate for simulation of arbitrary components and heterogeneous materials, such as anisotropic welds or composite structures. Finite element analysis software (FEA), such as PZFlex, can provide the ability to simulate the inspection of these arrangements, providing the ability to economically prototype and evaluate improved NDE methods. FEA is often seen as computationally expensive for ultrasound problems however, advances in computing power have made it a more viable tool. This paper aims to illustrate the capability of appropriate FEA to produce accurate simulations of ultrasonic array inspections – minimizing the requirement for expensive test-piece fabrication. Validation is afforded via corroboration of the FE derived and experimentally generated data sets for a test-block comprising 1D and 2D defects. The modelling approach is extended to consider the more troublesome aspects of heterogeneous materials where defect dimensions can be of the same length scale as the grain structure. The model is used to facilitate the implementation of new ultrasonic array inspection methods for such materials. This is exemplified by considering the simulation of ultrasonic NDE in a weld structure in order to assess new approaches to imaging such structures.},

UPT provides defect selective imaging using thermal waves generated by elastic waves. The use of short ultrasound bursts instead of sinusoidal signals for excitation allows for faster measurements and better reproducibility as compared to ULT. However, the advantages of phase images are the same: recognition of defect depth and suppression of temperature gradients. Application of UPT to typical defects of aircraft materials and components provide specific information on their nature.},

Smart methods for assessing the integrity of an aircraft structure are essential to both reduce manufacturing costs and out-of-service time of aircraft due to maintenance. Nowadays, thermal non-destructive testing (NDT) is commonly used for assessing aircraft composites. In this work, certain applications of transient thermal NDT relating to the assessment of aircraft composites are presented. In particular, the following features were studied:

(a) Notches under multi-ply composite patching (bonded with FM73 adhesive film to the surface of Al 2024-T3) and a simulated delamination between two plies on a multi-ply composite repair.

(b) Drilling induced defects on multi-ply laminates of HEXCEL AS4/8552 carbon fibre composites.

(c) Impact damage on carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) panels and honeycomb sandwich structures (bonded with AF-163-2U.03 adhesive film).

(d) Through skin sensing assessment of CFRP.

Real-time monitoring of all features was obtained using pulsed thermography. However, in the composite repairs cases thermal modelling and pulsed-phase thermography were also used with the intention of providing supplementary results, whilst in the case of through skin imaging thermal modelling was also used in order to demonstrate the importance of thermal contact resistance between two surfaces (skin and strut). The thermal NDT approaches used in this work gave satisfactory results in all instances.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources have gained much attention due to the recent energy crisis and the urge to get clean energy. Among the main options being studied, wind energy is a strong contender because of its reliability due to the maturity of the technology, good infrastructure and relative cost competitiveness. In order to harvest wind energy more efficiently, the size of wind turbines has become physically larger, making maintenance and repair works difficult. In order to improve safety considerations, to minimize down time, to lower the frequency of sudden breakdowns and associated huge maintenance and logistic costs and to provide reliable power generation, the wind turbines must be monitored from time to time to ensure that they are in good condition. Among all the monitoring systems, the structural health monitoring (SHM) system is of primary importance because it is the structure that provides the integrity of the system. SHM systems and the related non-destructive test and evaluation methods are discussed in this review. As many of the methods function on local damage, the types of damage that occur commonly in relation to wind turbines, as well as the damage hot spots, are also included in this review.},

As with most configurations (frequency, thickness) ultrasonic waves with many modes of propagation are generated, recent research focuses mostly on the generation and reception of specific modes, mainly by means of sophisticated arrays of transducers. In this paper this problem is addressed with a different approach, by processing ultrasonic signals with a low signal/noise ratio acquired with a single transducer in an pulse–echo configuration. In order to improve the evaluation of results, frequency bandpass filters and wavelet analysis were tested. Results showed that even when very noisy signals are utilized, signal processing improve the signal/noise (S/N) ratio up to 12 dB approximately and enhance the analysis of the results, thus demonstrating its usefulness.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of kilometers of pipeline, especially the elbows and welded joints in nuclear power plants (NPPs), are susceptible to aging and other types of damage. Therefore, the condition of a piping system requires regular inspection. We propose an automatic damage visualization technique using a laser ultrasonic scanning system and an ultrasonic wave propagation imaging (UWPI) method for the regular inspection process. Ultrasonic wave propagation movies (UWPMs) in thick and complex NPP pipes could be successfully visualized in a straight pipe with a crack, a welded pipe with multiple open and inner cracks at the welds, and an elbow pipe with wall thinning. A UWPM with ultrasonic time information could enable the discrimination of damage-induced wavefields from the wavefield not related to damage by providing the appearance time, source location, wavefront curvature, and propagation direction of the damage-induced wavefield. For the specimens tested, a 1 mm long crack in a 9 mm thick pipe could be localized regardless of the relative orientation of a sensor to the crack direction; 4 mm long 1.5 mm deep inner crack in a 4 mm thick welding bead could be detected despite the presence of the welding bead; wall thinning with gradual property variations could also be detected. In addition, since this method did not require laser focusing or reference data from the undamaged condition, and allows a large laser beam incident angle, it was very advantageous for the automatic scanning of the curved pipe surfaces. This study demonstrated that the proposed laser ultrasonic system equipped with the UWPI method is a useful inspection tool for NPP piping system management.},

The applications range from through transmission testing of aerospace laminates and various honeycomb or foam filled materials, and solar cells, to pulse-echo flaw detection in plastic electronic packaging materials and in-line inspection of large-diameter gas pipelines. Most of the new applications have been made possible by major advances in component technologies: transducers, preamplifiers, pulsers, signal-conditioning, and impedance matching and noise-matching circuits. In this paper, we describe the transducer types and circuit topologies that are especially suitable for applications in the 20 kHz to 20 MHz frequency region. We also address the important key differences between air-coupled and liquid-coupled inspection configurations. In particular, we focus on the practical advantages and limitations that arise from the fact that gases and liquids exhibit substantially different specific densities and sound speeds},

Am. 2 8, 168 (1956)] which predicts that three different kinds of bulk waves may propagate in the fluid‐saturated porous solid, the wave equation is solved to determine the energy reflection and transmission coefficients of plane elastic waves at oblique incidence on an interface between a fluid and a fluid‐saturated porous solid. For this purpose, the necessary formalism of the energy equation, the Poynting energy flux vector, and the sound intensity of elastic waves in fluid‐saturated porous media are presented. Two general cases of mode conversion have been investigated: (1) The initial wave is incident from the fluid to the interface and generates three transmitted bulk waves in the fluid‐saturated porous solid, and (2) the initial wave is incident from the fluid‐saturated porous solid to the interface and generates three reflected bulk waves in the same medium. Furthermore, the transmission of sound through a fluid‐saturated porous solid plate immersed in fluid is calculated. Measurement of sound transmission through a porous plate was carried out using experimental techniques suggested by Plona [Appl. Phys. Lett. 3 6, 259 (1980)]. Good correlation between measured and calculated values of the angular behavior of the transmission coefficients for fast, shear, and slow waves was obtained after adjusting the theory for experimentally obtained attenuation.},

Toward this end, design criteria for the matching layers and possible configurations are reviewed. Among the several factors that affect the efficiency of the matching layer, the importance of attenuation is pointed out. A standard characterization procedure is applied to a wide collection of candidate materials to produce matching layers. In particular, some types of filtration membranes are studied. From these results, the best materials are identified, and the better matching configuration is proposed. Four pairs of air-coupled piezoelectric transducers also are produced to illustrate the performance of the proposed solution. The lowest two-way insertion loss figure is -24 dB obtained at 0.45 MHz. This increases for higher frequency transducers up to -42 dB at 1.8 MHz and -50 at 2.25 MHz. Typical bandwidth is about 15-20\%.},

It is found that most of the work done by the external force on the lattice system is stored by the internal mass if the forcing frequency is close to the local resonance frequency. However, the energy stored in the internal mass is only temporary; it is taken out by the external force in the form of negative work in a cyclic manner. This behavior is utilized to design metamaterials for preventing stress waves from passing them.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel and flexible method for reliable and robust defect detection in difficult materials. It is well known in the literature that the interaction between ultrasonic beams and the insonified medium is a highly nonlinear process, which potentially exhibits distinctive frequency-dependent properties for defects and random reflectors with a degree of randomness. Instead of investigating the structure and pattern of the spectrum of an individual echo, the proposed method focuses on the distinction between the ensembles of defect signals and clutter noise. A training process is used to establish the statistical analysis, based on which a hypothesis test is then applied to received echoes to detect defects. The approach is expected to be adaptive to the material microstructure and characteristics due to the statistical training. Experiments with a 5MHz transducer on austenitic steel samples from a coal fired power station are conducted. Austenitic steel is highly scattering and attenuating, and the method demonstrates accurate and reliable defect detection. When applied to A-scan waveforms, the grain noise is significantly reduced while defect signals are enhanced, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved by about 20dB. As a result, the defect is more visible and can be readily identified in B-scan images. Initial results indicate that this method is robust and delivers good performance without additional calibration and compensation.},

	abstract = {Materials with a coarse grain structure are becoming increasingly prevalent in industry due to their resilience to stress and corrosion. These materials are difficult to inspect with ultrasound because reflections from the grains lead to high noise levels which hinder the echoes of interest. Spatially Averaged Sub-Aperture Correlation Imaging (SASACI) is an advanced array beamforming technique that uses the cross-correlation between images from array sub-apertures to generate an image weighting matrix, in order to reduce noise levels. This paper presents a method inspired by SASACI to further improve imaging using phase information to refine focusing and reduce noise. A-scans from adjacent array elements are cross-correlated using both signal amplitude and phase to refine delay laws and minimize phase aberration. The phase-based and amplitude-based corrected images are used as inputs to a two-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm that will output a weighting matrix that can be applied to any conventional image. This approach was validated experimentally using a 5MHz array a coarse grained Inconel 625 step wedge, and compared to the Total Focusing Method (TFM). Initial results have seen SNR improvements of over 20dB compared to TFM, and a resolution that is much higher.},

This in-house developed TFM code allows for interactive evaluation of image quality indicators of ultrasonic imaging performance when utilizing a 2D phased array working in FMC/TFM mode. The cueMAP software uses a series of TFM images to build a map of resolution, contrast and sensitivity of imaging performance of a simulated reflector, swept across the inspection volume. The software takes into account probe properties, wedge or water standoff, and effects of specimen curvature. In the validation process of this new software package, two 2D arrays have been evaluated on 304n stainless steel samples, typical of the primary circuit in nuclear plants. Thick section samples have been inspected using a 1MHz 2D matrix array. Due to the processing efficiency of the software, the data collected from these array configurations has been used to investigate the influence sub-aperture operation on inspection performance.},

	abstract = {Full matrix capture (FMC) ultrasound can be used to generate a permanent re-focusable record of data describing the geometry of a part; a valuable asset for an inspection process. FMC is a desirable acquisition mode for automated scanning of complex geometries, as it allows compensation for surface shape in post processing and application of the total focusing method. However, automating the delivery of such FMC inspection remains a significant challenge for real industrial processes due to the high data overhead associated with the ultrasonic acquisition. The benefits of NDE delivery using six-axis industrial robots are well versed when considering complex inspection geometries, but such an approach brings additional challenges to scanning speed and positional accuracy when combined with FMC inspection. This study outlines steps taken to optimize the scanning speed and data management of a process to scan the diffusion bonded membrane of a titanium test plate. A system combining a KUKA robotic arm and a reconfigurable FMC phased array controller is presented. The speed and data implications of different scanning methods are compared, and the impacts on data visualization quality are discussed with reference to this study. For the 0.5 m2 sample considered, typical acquisitions of 18 TB/m2 were measured for a triple back wall FMC acquisition, illustrating the challenge of combining high data throughput with acceptable scanning speeds.},

To accomplish this task we have developed a 3D reflection tomography software (called jerry) that is designed to handle methods of realistic complexity and that is fast enough to allow practical 3D applications. We use a blocky representation of the subsurface with a B-Spline parametrization for interface geometries and for velocity distributions within layers. The forward problem of reflection tomography is formulated as a two-point ray tracing problem and is solved by a bending method based on Fermat's principle with an approximation of the actual ray geometry within a layer by a straight line. The C2 property of the model parametrization allows to calculate exact derivatives of the traveltime function with respect to the model and thus to calculate rays (trajectories that satisfy Fermat's principle) from initial trial trajectories. The trajectory initialization is based on Snell's law for transmission/reflection at interfaces and uses an iterative method to calculate the intersection point between straight rays and interfaces. The introduction of non-physical ghost interfaces allows to improve the ray path approximation and thus the accuracy of the calculated traveltimes.},

	title = {2D ultrasonic phased arrays for quantitative characterisation of complex defects},
	abstract = {Ultrasonic inspection can be consideredas one of many ways the technical system - installation or vehicle - can be made economical and safe. Contemporary ultrasonic systems are capable of detecting a wide variety of mechanical defects and flaws that may or may not affect the operation of a given product. Ultrasonic testing techniques are widely accepted for quality control and material testing. Moreover, the technology is proven, well-understood and widely used. Upon detecting a flaw, a decision has to be made to ensure the component is fit for the purpose: is the flaw acceptable or is repair of the given part or its replacement? Here, 2D ultrasonic phased arrays hold promise to quickly deliver detailed, 3D resolved information about the extent and nature of the flaw. This information can then be used to develop and justify the technical and economic decision concerning the existing state of the product. In effect, an opportunity exists for significant cost savings by using ultrasonic 2D phased array systems for defect characterisation. The interest of the work is to establish a process of designing and manufacturing of piezoelectric, 2D phased array ultrasound probes for application in non-destructive evaluation of materials. Furthermore, implementation of practical signal processing method is investigated. In the first part of the work the sensor mechanical and electrical design is addressed. The properties of piezoelectric ceramic composite materials are studied. Detailed numerical models have been used to analyse conditions required for crafting materials of desirable properties. A novel technique has been demonstrated that allows design of well-behaved triangular cut piezoelectric composite., Built into a single array element (of hexagonal shape by taking 6 triangular pillars) this new composite exhibits properties comparable to a reference rectangular composite (sensitivity of 0.60nm/V for hexagonal, 0.62nm/V for square; and inter-element crosstalk of -21.2dB for hexagonal and -21.9dB for square element). This composite then allows building of compact, dense-layout 2D phased array transducers with hexagonal or sparse element layout. The benefits of hexagonal element layout over classic, rectangular layout have been analysed theoretically and showed to be beneficial. Importantly, using hexagonal elements enables increasing the aperture of individual array elements by approximately 10\% without the corresponding drop in acceptance angle. This in turn allows a commensurable rise in the sensitivity of the sensor or alternatively, reduction in array element count for a given overall array aperture by over 20\% without the corresponding drop in the image quality measurements/levels. In the second part of the work, the problem of high output impedance of the miniature ultrasonic sensor is addressed by means of an in-probe miniature signal conditioning circuit. This improved the response amplitude of the element by 36dB and shortened its impulse response by a factor of 1.6. The novelty and practical benefit in this case lies in the fact that no high power components are needed in the probe body. In the third part of this work, an emerging General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) computer architecture is considered for the opportunities it offers to rethink the implementation of algorithms typically used in ultrasonic signal processing. Single-way beamforming, and two-way TFM and PCF beamforming have been developed for execution on the new platform, and show increase in performance of over 930 times compared to CPU processor., This software platform has been further enhanced by a new approach to solving the refracted ray Time of Flight problem in a way that is particularly well suited for this architecture. This resulted in a further increase of performance, i.e. 56x over the best published result found in the literature. The unprecedented performance and low cost of this new approach enables industrial deployment of advanced beamforming methods, as well as building of practical CAD tools for engineering and education.},
