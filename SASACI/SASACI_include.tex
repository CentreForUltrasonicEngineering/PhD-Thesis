\paragraph{Flaw 1}

Flaw 1 is a side-wall crack angled at 35$^{\circ}$ with respect to the normal. It has a length of 30mm, is 6mm tall and the processed images of this flaw can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw1}. The reflection from the flaw is strong and the defect can be seen even in the unfiltered TFM image. As expected, the filtered TFM image reduces a significant portion of the noise and allows the defect to be seen more clearly. The SASACI process reduces this noise (measured by taking the mean amplitude in the highlighted area - this area is consistent throughout the following results) by a further 5dB, though the defect is already visible in the previous image and accurate sizing is possible.

\paragraph{Flaw 2}

Flaw 2 is a lack of side wall fusion. It is angled at 40$^{\circ}$ with respect to the normal and has a length and height of 30mm and 6mm respectively. The image results of this flaw are shown in Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw2}. It can be immediately observed from the first of the three images that this section of the weld has much less grain noise compared to the section in which Flaw 1 is located. The background noise level is significantly lower and the defect can be clearly seen. The filtered TFM reduces some of the noise surrounding the backwall and SASACI is able to further reduce some of the noise surrounding the defect.

\paragraph{Flaw 3}

Flaw 3 is a vertical centreline crack within the weld. It is 45mm long and 6mm tall. It starts at the bottom of the sample and protrudes upwards. Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw3} shows images of the region in which the flaw is located. No useful information can be observed in the unfiltered TFM image. There is a significant amount of noise surrounding the back wall which hinders analysis of the image. The filtered TFM image reduces noise but it is still not clear where the defect is located. The SASACI image shows further reduced noise, to a point where the top of the defect can be observed. It should be stated that the experimental setup is not optimal for detecting Flaws 3, 4 and 5. To detect vertical flaws, inspection should take place with an angled beam which allows for more energy to be reflected from the defect. A wedge would allow for this.

\paragraph{Flaw 4}

Flaw 4 is also a vertical centreline crack. It is smaller than Flaw 3, being 40mm long and only 5mm tall. This flaw is starts at the top of the sample and protrudes downwards towards the centre of the weld. This flaw cannot be seen in any of the three images shown in Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw4}.

\paragraph{Flaw 5}

Flaw 5 is a vertical centreline crack in the centre of the weld. It is larger than the previous flaws and is 50mm in length and 14mm in height. The top of the crack can be seen in the unfiltered TFM image in Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw5}, however the bottom cannot be seen due to the noise around the back wall. The filtered image reduces noise, allowing the top of the crack to be seen clearly. In this case, the bottom of the crack still cannot clearly be seen due to noise. The SASACI image reduces this noise further to a point where the location of the bottom of the crack can be estimated to allow sizing.

\paragraph{Flaw 6}

Flaw 6 is a lack of side wall fusion and is at an angle of 35$^{\circ}$ with respect to the normal. The crack is sized 50mm in length and 4mm tall. Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw6} shows the three images related to this defect. The unfiltered TFM image is very noisy due to the grain structure within the weld. The bandpass filtering reduces noise to the point where the defect can be seen above the noise and SASACI further reduces this noise by around 10dB.

\paragraph{Flaw 7}

Flaw 7 is a transverse crack at the top of the sample and is 40mm long and 4mm in height. This defect cannot be seen in any of the three images represented in Figure \ref{fig:AMEC_flaw7}. The filtered TFM and SASACI images show clear horizontal artefacts that are also present in Flaw 4. While the defects near the top of the sample cannot be seen in any of the images, it is possible that the flaws are contributing to these artefacts. The orientation of this defect is such that it is expected to be found. There is currently no explanation for the fact that the defect cannot be seen in any of the images.
