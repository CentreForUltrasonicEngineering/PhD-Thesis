Foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Anthony Gachagan, for his advice, encouragement and continued patience.

My thanks extend to all I have worked with throughout this study, in particular Jerzy Dziewierz. The members of the Centre for Ultrasonic Engineering have made my time as a PhD student both enjoyable and fulfilling.

I would like to thank Weidlinger Associates, Royal Dutch Shell, Rolls-Royce, National Nuclear Laboratory, Amec Foster Wheeler, Siemens and E.ON for their contributions to this body of work. This work was funded by the aforementioned companies via the Research Council for Non-Destructive Evaluation and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

My gratitude extends to all of my family, and in particular my parents, Roseanne and Patrick, Kathleen and of course Mary O'Neill.

Thanks to Adam Crawford, Michael Ferguson and Gary McLelland for their support and advice, but mostly for the pints.

Finally, I am eternally grateful to my girlfriend Adele who has been at my side throughout this process and without whom the completion of this work certainly would not have been possible.
