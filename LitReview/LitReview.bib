	abstract = {Piezoelectric materials have dominated the ultrasonic transducer technology. Recently, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers ({CMUTs)} have emerged as an alternative technology offering advantages such as wide bandwidth, ease of fabricating large arrays, and potential for integration with electronics. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the viability of {CMUTs} for ultrasound imaging. We present the first pulse-echo phased array B-scan sector images using a 128-element, one-dimensional (1-D) linear {CMUT} array. We fabricated 64- and 128-element 1-D {CMUT} arrays with 100\% yield and uniform element response across the arrays. These arrays have been operated in immersion with no failure or degradation in performance over the time. For imaging experiments, we built a resolution test phantom roughly mimicking the attenuation properties of soft tissue. We used a {PC-based} experimental system, including custom-designed electronic circuits to acquire the complete set of 128/spl times/128 {RF} A-scans from all transmit-receive element combinations. We obtained the pulse-echo frequency response by analyzing the echo signals from wire targets. These echo signals presented an 80\% fractional bandwidth around 3 {MHz}, including the effect of attenuation in the propagating medium. We reconstructed the B-scan images with a sector angle of 90 degrees and an image depth of 210 mm through offline processing by using {RF} beamforming and synthetic phased array approaches. The measured 6-{dB} lateral and axial resolutions at 135 mm depth were 0.0144 radians and 0.3 mm, respectively. The electronic noise floor of the image was more than 50 {dB} below the maximum mainlobe magnitude. We also performed preliminary investigations on the effects of crosstalk among array elements on the image quality. In the near field, some artifacts were observable extending out from the array to a depth of 2 cm. A tail also was observed in the point spread function ({PSF)} in the axial direction, indicating the - - existence of crosstalk. The relative amplitude of this tail with respect to the mainlobe was less than -20 {dB.}},

	abstract = {Processing of ultrasonic array data is traditionally based on having parallel transmission circuits that enable staggered firing of transmitter elements to produce the desired wavefront. This paper describes an alternative approach in which the full matrix of time domain signals from every transmitter–receiver pair is captured and post-processed. Various post-processing approaches are modelled and assessed in terms of their ability to image a point-like reflector. Experimental results are then presented which show good quantitative agreement with the modelled results. An advanced processing algorithm is also implemented which allows the array to be focused at every point in the target region in both transmission and reception. This approach is shown to offer significant performance advantages for {NDE.}},

	abstract = {Single-crystal metal alloys are used extensively in the manufacture of jet engine components for their excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The inspection of these components using 2-D ultrasonic arrays potentially allows the detection of subsurface defects in three-dimensions from one inspection location. Such methods are not currently suitable for the inspection of single-crystal components because the high elastic anisotropy of single-crystal materials causes directional variation in ultrasonic waves. In this paper, a model of wave propagation in anisotropic material is used to correct an ultrasonic imaging algorithm and is applied to a single-crystal test specimen. For this corrected-algorithm, the orientation of the crystal in a specimen must be known before the inspection. Using the same ultrasonic array to measure the orientation and perform the defect inspection offers the most practical solution. Therefore, potential crystallographic orientation methods using 2-D ultrasonic arrays are also developed and evaluated.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound detection and evaluation of flaws in materials showing structural noise (austenitic steels, titanium alloys, composites, etc.) is difficult because of the low flaw-to-grain noise ratio. Much research has been performed looking for methods to improve flaw detection in grained materials. Many approaches require a cumbersome tuning process to select the correct parameter values or to use iterative techniques. In this work, the technique of phase coherence imaging is proposed to improve the flaw-to-grain noise ratio. The technique weights the output of a conventional beamformer with a coherence factor obtained from the aperture data phase dispersion. It can be simply implemented in real-time and it operates automatically, without needing any parameter adjustment. This paper presents the theoretical basis of phase coherence imaging to reduce grain noise, as well as experimental results that confirm the expected performance.},

	volume = {50},
	issn = {0885-3010},
	abstract = {Sound-velocity inhomogeneities degrade both spatial and contrast resolutions. This paper proposes a new adaptive imaging technique that uses the generalized coherence factor ({GCF)} to reduce the focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. The {GCF} is derived from the spatial spectrum of the received aperture data after proper receive delays have been applied. It is defined as the ratio of the spectral energy within a prespecified low-frequency range to the total energy. It is demonstrated that the low-frequency component of the spectrum corresponds to the coherent portion of the received data, and that the high-frequency component corresponds to the incoherent portion. Hence, the {GCF} reduces to the coherence factor defined in the literature if the prespecified low-frequency range is restricted to dc only. In addition, the {GCF} is also an index of the focusing quality and can be used as a weighting factor for the reconstructed image. The efficacy of the {GCF} technique is demonstrated for focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. Simulations and real ultrasound data are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed {GCF} technique. The characteristics of the {GCF}, including the effects of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channels, are also discussed. The {GCF} technique also is compared with the correlation-based technique and the parallel adaptive receive compensation algorithm; the improvement in image quality obtained with the proposed technique rivals that of the latter technique. In the presence of a displaced phase screen, this proposed technique also outperforms the correlation-based technique. Computational complexity and implementation issues also are addressed.},

This technique uses dual apodization or weighting strategies that are effective in removing or minimizing clutter and efficient in terms of computational load and hardware/software needs. This dual apodization allows us to determine the amount of mainlobe versus clutter contribution in a signal by cross-correlating {RF} data acquired from 2 apodization functions. Simulation results using a 128 element 5 {MHz} linear array show an improvement in {CNR} of 139\% compared with standard beamformed data with uniform apodization in a 3 mm diameter anechoic cylindrical cyst.
