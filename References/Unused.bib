	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel sidelobe and clutter suppression method in ultrasound imaging called dual apodization with cross-correlation or DAX. DAX dramatically improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) allowing for easier visualization of anechoic cysts and blood vessels. This technique uses dual apodization or weighting strategies that are effective in removing or minimizing clutter and efficient in terms of computational load and hardware/software needs. This dual apodization allows us to determine the amount of mainlobe versus clutter contribution in a signal by cross-correlating RF data acquired from 2 apodization functions. Simulation results using a 128 element 5 MHz linear array show an improvement in CNR of 139\% compared with standard beamformed data with uniform apodization in a 3 mm diameter anechoic cylindrical cyst. Experimental CNR using a tissue-mimicking phantom with the same sized cyst shows an improvement of 123\% in a DAX processed image.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new beamformer which combines the eigenspace-based minimum variance (ESBMV) beamformer with the Wiener postfilter is proposed for medical ultrasound imaging. The primary goal of this work is to further improve the medical ultrasound imaging quality on the basis of the ESBMV beamformer. In this method, we optimize the ESBMV weights with a Wiener postfilter. With the optimization of the Wiener postfilter, the output power of the new beamformer becomes closer to the actual signal power at the imaging point than the ESBMV beamformer. Different from the ordinary Wiener postfilter, the output signal and noise power needed in calculating the Wiener postfilter are estimated respectively by the orthogonal signal subspace and noise subspace constructed from the eigenstructure of the sample covariance matrix. We demonstrate the performance of the new beamformer when resolving point scatterers and cyst phantom using both simulated data and experimental data and compare it with the delay-and-sum (DAS), the minimum variance (MV) and the ESBMV beamformer. We use the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the peak-side-lobe level (PSL) to quantify the performance of imaging resolution and the contrast ratio (CR) to quantify the performance of imaging contrast. The FWHM of the new beamformer is only 15\%, 50\% and 50\% of those of the DAS, MV and ESBMV beamformer, while the PSL is 127.2 dB, 115 dB and 60 dB lower. What is more, an improvement of 239.8\%, 232.5\% and 32.9\% in CR using simulated data and an improvement of 814\%, 1410.7\% and 86.7\% in CR using experimental data are achieved compared to the DAS, MV and ESBMV beamformer respectively. In addition, the effect of the sound speed error is investigated by artificially overestimating the speed used in calculating the propagation delay and the results show that the new beamformer provides better robustness against the sound speed errors. Therefore, the proposed beamformer offers a better performance than the DAS, MV and ESBMV beamformer, showing its potential in medical ultrasound imaging.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenging problem of ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) imaging with adaptive transducer arrays. In NDE applications, most materials like concrete, stainless steel and carbon-reinforced composites used extensively in industries and civil engineering exhibit heterogeneous internal structure. When inspected using ultrasound, the signals from defects are significantly corrupted by the echoes form randomly distributed scatterers, even defects that are much larger than these random reflectors are difficult to detect with the conventional delay-and-sum operation. We propose to apply adaptive beamforming to the received data samples to reduce the interference and clutter noise. Beamforming is to manipulate the array beam pattern by appropriately weighting the per-element delayed data samples prior to summing them. The adaptive weights are computed from the statistical analysis of the data samples. This delay-weight-and-sum process can be explained as applying a lateral spatial filter to the signals across the probe aperture. Simulations show that the clutter noise is reduced by more than 30 dB and the lateral resolution is enhanced simultaneously when adaptive beamforming is applied. In experiments inspecting a steel block with side-drilled holes, good quantitative agreement with simulation results is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This work presents a novel method for digital ultrasound beamforming based on programmable table look-ups, in which vectors containing coded focusing information are efficiently stored, achieving an information density of a fraction of bit per acquired sample. Timing errors at the foci are within half the period of a master clock of arbitrarily high frequency to improve imaging quality with low resource requirements. The technique is applicable with conventional as well as with DeltaSigma converters. The bit-width of the focusing code and the number of samples per focus can be defined to improve both memory size and F\# with controlled timing errors. In the static mode, the number of samples per focus is fixed, and in the dynamic approach that figure grows progressively, taking advantage of the increasing depth of focus. Furthermore, the latter has the lowest memory requirements. The technique is well suited for research purposes as well as for real-world applications, offering a degree of freedom not available with other approaches. It allows, for example, modifying the sampling instants to phase aberration correction, beamforming in layered structures, etc. The described modular and scalable prototype has been built using low-cost field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

	doi = {10.1109/58.646925},
	abstract = {A new imaging technique has been proposed that combines conventional B-mode and synthetic aperture imaging techniques to overcome the limited depth of field for a highly focused transducer. The new technique improves lateral resolution beyond the focus of the transducer by considering the focus a virtual element and applying synthetic aperture focusing techniques. In this paper, the use of the focus as a virtual element is examined, considering the issues that are of concern when imaging with an array of actual elements: the tradeoff between lateral resolution and sidelobe level, the tradeoff between system complexity (channel count/amount of computation) and the appearance of grating lobes, and the issue of signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the processed image. To examine these issues, pulse-echo RF signals were collected for a tungsten wire in degassed water, monofilament nylon wires in a tissue-mimicking phantom, and cyst targets in the phantom. Results show apodization lowers the sidelobes, but only at the expense of lateral resolution, as is the case for classical synthetic aperture imaging. Grating lobes are not significant until spatial sampling is more than one wavelength, when the beam is not steered. Resolution comparable to the resolution at the transducer focus can be achieved beyond the focal region while obtaining an acceptable SNR. Specifically, for a 15-MHz focused transducer, the 6-dB beamwidth at the focus is 157 /spl mu/m, and with synthetic aperture processing the 6-dB beamwidths at 3, 5, and 7 mm beyond the focus are 189 /spl mu/m, 184 /spl mu/m, and 215 /spl mu/m, respectively. The image SNR is 38.6 dB when the wire is at the focus, and it is 32.8 dB, 35.3 dB, and 38.1 dB after synthetic aperture processing when the wire is 3, 5, and 7 mm beyond the focus, respectively. With these experiments, the virtual source has been shown to exhibit the same behavior as an actual transducer element in response to synthetic aperture processing techniques.},

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0116},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel and flexible method for reliable and robust defect detection in difficult materials. It is well known in the literature that the interaction between ultrasonic beams and the insonified medium is a highly nonlinear process, which potentially exhibits distinctive frequency-dependent properties for defects and random reflectors with a degree of randomness. Instead of investigating the structure and pattern of the spectrum of an individual echo, the proposed method focuses on the distinction between the ensembles of defect signals and clutter noise. A training process is used to establish the statistical analysis, based on which a hypothesis test is then applied to received echoes to detect defects. The approach is expected to be adaptive to the material microstructure and characteristics due to the statistical training. Experiments with a 5MHz transducer on austenitic steel samples from a coal fired power station are conducted. Austenitic steel is highly scattering and attenuating, and the method demonstrates accurate and reliable defect detection. When applied to A-scan waveforms, the grain noise is significantly reduced while defect signals are enhanced, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved by about 20dB. As a result, the defect is more visible and can be readily identified in B-scan images. Initial results indicate that this method is robust and delivers good performance without additional calibration and compensation.},

In this regard, synthetic aperture techniques have been very useful. They reduce hardware requirements and accelerate information capture. However, the beamforming process is still very slow, limiting the overall speed of the system. Recently, general-purpose computing on graphics processing unit techniques have been proposed as a way to accelerate image composition. They provide excellent computing power with which a very large volume of data can easily and quickly be processed. This paper describes a new system architecture that merges both principles. Thus, using a minimum-redundancy synthetic aperture technique to acquire the signals (2R-SAFT), and a graphics processing unit as a beamformer, we have developed a new scanner with full dynamic focusing, both on emission and reception, that attains real-time imaging with very few resources.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to interactively compute two-sided refraction on GPU and gains comparable realistic effects with ray tracing, while most current interactive techniques are restricted to single refraction. Our approach is also efficient for total internal reflection (TIR). When processing rigid movable object, we render the object's normal to a cube map first before entering the render loop. And for deformable object, the object's normal is rendered to a cube map at each frame. Then we compute the back interface refraction point by binary search in fragment shader. At last the refracted color is determined by indexing into a distant environment cube map using the second refracted ray as texture coordinate. Because our approach can fully exploit the capabilities of GPU, it achieves realistic refraction results and interactive frame rate even for fairly complex objects on common PCs.},

	abstract = {When material is subjected to an intense load its stiffness changes due to elastic nonlinearity. This effect is especially pronounced in damaged materials so that nonlinearity can be used as an indication of incipient damage. Under dynamic load, mechanical constraint between the fragments of planar defects provides gigantic nonlinearity in finite-amplitude contact vibrations. The local vibration spectra acquire a number of new frequency components which are used as signatures of damage. The experimental implementation of nonlinear NDT relies on the use of laser interferometers (Nonlinear Laser Vibrometry, NLV) to detect the nonlinear waves that are generated selectively by defects. Besides, the planar defects as localized sources of nonlinear vibrations efficiently radiate nonlinear airborne ultrasound (Nonlinear Air-Coupled Emission, NACE). The frequency conversion mechanism concerned with contact nonlinearity of the defect vibrations provides an efficient generation of aircoupled higher-order ultra-harmonics, ultra-subharmonics, and combination frequencies. Both the NLV and NACE are proposed for remote scanning and high contrast defect-selective imaging in nonlinear NDT. Key words: Nonlinear NDT, defect-selective imaging, nonlinear air-coupled emission. 1.},

	abstract = {We have recently presented a new method to suppress side lobes and clutter in ultrasound imaging called dual apodization with cross-correlation or DAX. This method uses two apodization functions in receive mode which yield point spread functions with very similar main lobes but different side lobes and clutter. These similarities and differences are quantified by using normalized cross-correlation of the radio frequency (RF) data in the axial direction. These cross-correlation coefficients serve as a pixel-by-pixel weighting or filter to pass main lobe dominated signals and suppress clutter dominated signals. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of DAX in the presence of phase aberration and noise. Aberrating layers of pig skin, fat, and muscle were used experimentally to mimic different level of aberrators. Experimental results are also presented using DAX in the presence of noise. With system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least 15 dB, we have a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) improvement of over 100 \% compared to standard beamforming. This work shows that DAX is able to reliably improve contrast-to-noise ratio in the presence of phase aberration and noise.},

In the coarse scan mode with the scan step of 50 mm, the system can quickly give an image display of a cross section of 600 mm (L) × 300 mm (D) by one measurement. In the refined scan model, the system can reduce the scan step and give an image display of the same cross section by moving the sensor array several times.

(ii) Appearing side lobes significantly spoil resolution. Therefore, the reasons for side lobes require further research. Side lobes can either be caused by grating lobes or by insufficiently steered sound-field beams of the peripheral array elements. Adequate remedies are suggested: the classification of side lobes provides the best opportunity to improve the control mode. The study is done by calculating the time harmonic sound field in water.

As an example of use, an application with pipe wall inspection is given. Inside the pipe wall, the intended location of the focus is achieved with small off-axis secondary structures. Thereby, double readings are avoided, and resolution is improved. To verify the results, the harmonic and transient sound fields are simulated and compared with each other.},

The numerical solution is replaced with a simple analytical solution through using the exponential substitution approach to remove the nonlinear integral terms. Therefore, the real-time inspection by using C-scan imaging systems of flaws in materials can be achieved through the proposed model. The research results show that the signal loss of double transmissions from random rough surfaces mainly depends on two factors: the root-mean-square (RMS) of the roughness and the depth of the flaw in materials. The experimentally measured signal loss is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The evaluation of the signal loss can be useful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the non-destructive testing (NDT).},

For block-matching methods, information from neighboring matching blocks has been utilized to regularize the estimated displacements. We apply a recursive Bayesian regularization algorithm developed by Hayton et al. [Artif. Intell., vol. 114, pp. 125-156, 1999] to phase-sensitive ultrasound RF signals to improve displacement estimation. The parameter of regularization is reformulated, and its meaning examined in the context of strain imaging. Tissue-mimicking experimental phantoms and RF data incorporating finite-element models for the tissue deformation and frequency-domain ultrasound simulations are used to compute the optimal parameter with respect to nominal strain and algorithmic iterations. The optimal strain regularization parameter was found to be twice the nominal strain and did not vary significantly with algorithmic iterations. The technique demonstrates superior performance over median filtering in noise reduction at strains 5\% and higher for all quantitative experiments performed. For example, the strain SNR was 11 dB higher than that obtained using a median filter at 7\% strain. It has to be noted that for applied deformations lower than 1\%, since signal decorrelation errors are minimal, using this approach may degrade the displacement image.},

The whole range of particle volume fraction (0-1) and ideal 0-3, 3-3 and intermediate 0-3/3-3 connectivities are analysed. Two different approaches to produce a realistic model of the complex microstructure of the composites are considered. The first one is based on a random location of mono-dispersed particles in the matrix; while the second incorporates a size distribution of the particles based on experimental measurements. Different particle shapes are also considered. A commercial finite element package was used to study the propagation of acoustic plane waves through the composite materials. Due to the complexity of the problem, and as a first step, a two-dimensional model was adopted. The results obtained for the velocity of sound propagation from the finite element technique are compared with those from other theoretical approaches and with experimental data. The study validates the use of this technique to model acoustic wave propagation in 0-3/3-3 connectivity composites. In addition, the finite element calculations, along with the detailed description of the microstructure of the composite, provide valuable information about the micromechanics of the sample and the influence of the microstructure on macroscopic properties.},

We apply this result to the problem of reconstructing the time-varying surface of a liquid from patterns placed below it. To do this, we introduce a novel \#x201C;stereo matching \#x201D; criterion called refractive disparity, appropriate for refractive scenes, and develop an optimization-based algorithm for individually reconstructing the position and normal of each point projecting to a pixel in the input views. Results on reconstructing a variety of complex, deforming liquid surfaces suggest that our technique can yield detailed reconstructions that capture the dynamic behavior of free-flowing liquids.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound (US) is a widely used clinical imaging modality that offers penetration depths in tissue of {\textgreater}10 cm. However, the spatial resolution in US imaging is fundamentally limited by diffraction to approximately half the wavelength of the sound wave employed. The spatial resolution of optical microscopy is limited by the same fundamental physics, but in recent years super-resolution imaging techniques have been developed that overcome the diffraction limit through the localization of many spatially separated photo-switchable or photo-activatable fluorophores. In this paper, we apply a related approach to demonstrate super-resolution imaging with US. We imaged dilute suspensions of microbubble contrast agents flowing through narrow tube-based phantoms. By spatially localizing multiple spatially isolated microbubbles, we constructed super-resolved microbubble location density maps that clearly resolve features 5.1–2.2 times smaller than the US system point spread function full width half maximum in the lateral and axial directions respectively. Our initial characterization experiment using a fixed 100 µm diameter brass wire and a US frequency of 2 MHz suggests that for an ideal stationary point scatterer the ultimate resolution of the unmodified clinical US system used could be in the range of 2–4 µm.},

	abstract = {Materials with a coarse grain structure are becoming increasingly prevalent in industry due to their resilience to stress and corrosion. These materials are difficult to inspect with ultrasound because reflections from the grains lead to high noise levels which hinder the echoes of interest. Spatially Averaged Sub-Aperture Correlation Imaging (SASACI) is an advanced array beamforming technique that uses the cross-correlation between images from array sub-apertures to generate an image weighting matrix, in order to reduce noise levels. This paper presents a method inspired by SASACI to further improve imaging using phase information to refine focusing and reduce noise. A-scans from adjacent array elements are cross-correlated using both signal amplitude and phase to refine delay laws and minimize phase aberration. The phase-based and amplitude-based corrected images are used as inputs to a two-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm that will output a weighting matrix that can be applied to any conventional image. This approach was validated experimentally using a 5MHz array a coarse grained Inconel 625 step wedge, and compared to the Total Focusing Method (TFM). Initial results have seen SNR improvements of over 20dB compared to TFM, and a resolution that is much higher.},

The proposed synthetic aperture method offers good dynamical resolution along with fast numerical reconstruction. In this study complex object data were recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower. Although it resulted in a slightly reduced spatial resolution this compromise has to be done for better resolution of low-contrast targets such as cysts. The study showed that cysts as small as 2 mm by diameter could be resolved.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Grating lobes in the two-way radiation pattern are avoided by using different element spacings on transmission and reception. The transmit and receive aperture functions are selected such that the convolution of the aperture functions produces a desired effective aperture. A desired effective aperture is simply an aperture with an appropriate width, element spacing, and shape such that the Fourier transform of this function gives the desired two-way radiation pattern. If a synthetic aperture approach is used, an exact solution to the problem is possible. However, for conventional imaging, often only an approximation of the desired effective aperture can be found. Different strategies for obtaining these approximate solutions are described. The radiation pattern of a sparse array designed using the effective aperture concept is compared experimentally with the radiation patterns of a dense array, and sparse arrays with periodic and random element spacing. We show that the number of elements in a 128-element linear array can be reduced by at least four times with little degradation of the beam forming properties of the array.},

	abstract = {Shadowing of an imaging aperture occurs when ultrasound beams are partially obstructed by an acoustically hard tissue, e.g., bone tissue. This effect leads to reduced resolution and, in some cases, geometrical distortion. In this paper, we initially introduce a binary apodization model to simulate effects of the shadowing on the point scatterers located close to a bone structure. Further, in a simulation study and an in vitro experiment, the minimum variance (MV) beamforming method is employed to image scatterers partly located in the shadow of bone. We show that the MV beamformer can result in a distorted image when the imaging aperture is highly obstructed by the bone structure. This distortion can be seen as an apparent lateral shift of the point spread function and a decrease in the sensitivity. Based on the signal power across the aperture, we adaptively determine the shadowed elements and discard their corresponding data from the covariance matrix to improve the MV beamformer performance. This modified MV beamformer can retain the resolution and compensate for the apparent lateral shifting and signal attenuation for the shadowed point scatterers.},

Typically, higher resolution and contrast is attainable using adaptive beamforming at the price of an increased computational load. In this paper, we describe a novel ABF designed for medical ultrasound, named the Time-domain Optimized Near-field Estimator (TONE). We performed a series of simulations using synthetic ultrasound data to test the performance of this algorithm and compared it to conventional, data independent, delay and sum beamforming (CBF) method. We also performed experiments using a Philips SONOS 5500 phased array imaging system. CBF was applied using the default parameters of the Philips scanner, whereas TONE was applied on per channel, unfocused data using an unfocused transmit beam. TONE images were reconstructed at a sampling of 67 microm laterally and 19 microm axially. The results obtained for a series of five 20-microm wires in a water tank show a significant improvement in spatial resolution when compared to CBF. We also analyzed the performance of TONE as a function of speed of sound errors and array sparsity, finding it robust to both.},

In this paper, we have used the minimum-variance beamformer to show how the low sidelobe levels and narrow beamwidth of adaptive methods can be used, not only to increase resolution, but also to enhance imaging in several ways. By using a minimum-variance beamformer instead of delay-and-sum on reception, reduced aperture, higher frame rates, or increased depth of penetration can be achieved without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate comparable resolution on images of wire targets and a cyst phantom obtained with a 96-element, 18.5-mm transducer using delay-and-sum, and a 48-element, 9.25-mm transducer using minimum variance. To increase frame rate, fewer and wider transmit beams in combination with several parallel receive beams may be used. We show comparable resolution to delay-and-sum using minimum variance, 1/4th of the number of transmit beams and 4 parallel receive beams, potentially increasing the frame rate by 4. Finally, we show that by lowering the frequency of the transmitted beam and beamforming the received data with the minimum variance beamformer, increased depth of penetration is achieved without sacrificing lateral resolution.},

	abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is extensively used for ultrasound imaging, despite the fact that it has lower resolution and worse interference suppression capability than the adaptive standard Capon beamformer (SCB) if the steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. The main problem which restricts the use of SCB, however, is that SCB lacks robustness against steering vector errors that are inevitable in practice. Whenever this happens, the performance of SCB may hecome worse than that of DAS. Therefore, a robust adaptive beamformer is desirable to maintain the robustness of DAS and adaptivity of SCB. In this paper we consider a recent promising robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for ultrasound imaging. We propose two ways of implementing RCB, one based on time delay and the other based on time reversal. RCB extends SCB by allowing the array steering vector to be within an uncertainty set. Hence, it restores the appeal of SCB including its high resolution and superb interference suppression capabilities, and also retains the attractiveness of DAS including its robustness against steering vector errors. The time-delay-based RCB can tolerate the misalignment of data samples and the time-reversal-based RCB can withstand the uncertainty of the Green's function. Both time-delay-based RCB and time-reversal-based RCB can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost to SCB. The excellent performances of the proposed robust adaptive beamforming approaches are demonstrated via a number of simulated and experimental examples.},
