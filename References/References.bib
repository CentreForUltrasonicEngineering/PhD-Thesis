	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel sidelobe and clutter suppression method in ultrasound imaging called dual apodization with cross-correlation or DAX. DAX dramatically improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) allowing for easier visualization of anechoic cysts and blood vessels. This technique uses dual apodization or weighting strategies that are effective in removing or minimizing clutter and efficient in terms of computational load and hardware/software needs. This dual apodization allows us to determine the amount of mainlobe versus clutter contribution in a signal by cross-correlating RF data acquired from 2 apodization functions. Simulation results using a 128 element 5 MHz linear array show an improvement in CNR of 139\% compared with standard beamformed data with uniform apodization in a 3 mm diameter anechoic cylindrical cyst. Experimental CNR using a tissue-mimicking phantom with the same sized cyst shows an improvement of 123\% in a DAX processed image.},

	title = {Adaptive imaging using the generalized coherence factor},
	volume = {50},
	issn = {0885-3010},
	abstract = {Sound-velocity inhomogeneities degrade both spatial and contrast resolutions. This paper proposes a new adaptive imaging technique that uses the generalized coherence factor (GCF) to reduce the focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. The GCF is derived from the spatial spectrum of the received aperture data after proper receive delays have been applied. It is defined as the ratio of the spectral energy within a prespecified low-frequency range to the total energy. It is demonstrated that the low-frequency component of the spectrum corresponds to the coherent portion of the received data, and that the high-frequency component corresponds to the incoherent portion. Hence, the GCF reduces to the coherence factor defined in the literature if the prespecified low-frequency range is restricted to dc only. In addition, the GCF is also an index of the focusing quality and can be used as a weighting factor for the reconstructed image. The efficacy of the GCF technique is demonstrated for focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. Simulations and real ultrasound data are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed GCF technique. The characteristics of the GCF, including the effects of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channels, are also discussed. The GCF technique also is compared with the correlation-based technique and the parallel adaptive receive compensation algorithm; the improvement in image quality obtained with the proposed technique rivals that of the latter technique. In the presence of a displaced phase screen, this proposed technique also outperforms the correlation-based technique. Computational complexity and implementation issues also are addressed.},

Much research has been performed looking for methods to improve flaw detection in grained materials. Many approaches require a cumbersome tuning process to select the correct parameter values or to use iterative techniques. In this work, the technique of phase coherence imaging is proposed to improve the flaw-to-grain noise ratio. The technique weights the output of a conventional beamformer with a coherence factor obtained from the aperture data phase dispersion. It can be simply implemented in real-time and it operates automatically, without needing any parameter adjustment. This paper presents the theoretical basis of phase coherence imaging to reduce grain noise, as well as experimental results that confirm the expected performance.},

	abstract = {Piezoelectric materials have dominated the ultrasonic transducer technology. Recently, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative technology offering advantages such as wide bandwidth, ease of fabricating large arrays, and potential for integration with electronics. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the viability of CMUTs for ultrasound imaging. We present the first pulse-echo phased array B-scan sector images using a 128-element, one-dimensional (1-D) linear CMUT array. We fabricated 64- and 128-element 1-D CMUT arrays with 100\% yield and uniform element response across the arrays. These arrays have been operated in immersion with no failure or degradation in performance over the time. For imaging experiments, we built a resolution test phantom roughly mimicking the attenuation properties of soft tissue. We used a PC-based experimental system, including custom-designed electronic circuits to acquire the complete set of 128/spl times/128 RF A-scans from all transmit-receive element combinations. We obtained the pulse-echo frequency response by analyzing the echo signals from wire targets. These echo signals presented an 80\% fractional bandwidth around 3 MHz, including the effect of attenuation in the propagating medium. We reconstructed the B-scan images with a sector angle of 90 degrees and an image depth of 210 mm through offline processing by using RF beamforming and synthetic phased array approaches. The measured 6-dB lateral and axial resolutions at 135 mm depth were 0.0144 radians and 0.3 mm, respectively. The electronic noise floor of the image was more than 50 dB below the maximum mainlobe magnitude. We also performed preliminary investigations on the effects of crosstalk among array elements on the image quality. In the near field, some artifacts were observable extending out from the array to a depth of 2 cm. A tail also was observed in the point spread function (PSF) in the axial direction, indicating the - - existence of crosstalk. The relative amplitude of this tail with respect to the mainlobe was less than -20 dB.},

The inspection of these components using 2-D ultrasonic arrays potentially allows the detection of subsurface defects in three-dimensions from one inspection location. Such methods are not currently suitable for the inspection of single-crystal components because the high elastic anisotropy of single-crystal materials causes directional variation in ultrasonic waves. In this paper, a model of wave propagation in anisotropic material is used to correct an ultrasonic imaging algorithm and is applied to a single-crystal test specimen. For this corrected-algorithm, the orientation of the crystal in a specimen must be known before the inspection. Using the same ultrasonic array to measure the orientation and perform the defect inspection offers the most practical solution. Therefore, potential crystallographic orientation methods using 2-D ultrasonic arrays are also developed and evaluated.},

In this paper a general imaging methodology, termed multi-mode total focusing method, is proposed in which any combination of modes and reflections can be used to produce an image of the test structure. Like the total focusing method, this approach is implemented by post-processing the full matrix of array data to achieve a synthetic focus at every pixel in the image. A hybrid model is used to predict the array data and demonstrate the performance of the multi-mode imaging concept. This hybrid model combines far field scattering coefficient matrices with a ray-based wave propagation model. This allows the inclusion of longitudinal waves, shear waves and wave mode conversions. It is shown that, with prior knowledge of likely scatterer location and orientation, the mode combination and array location can be optimised to maximise the performance of array inspections. A practically relevant weld inspection application is then described and its optimisation is discussed.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic C-scanning is widely used for large-area flaw detection but acquiring the full RF waveform for each surface point – Full Waveform Capture (FWC) – offers many advantages. A system that used phased arrays to achieve this without loss of area coverage rate has been reported(1). FWC allows many signal processing operations, previously only possible at acquisition, to be performed off-line. Multiple or time-consuming algorithms can be performed on the same data set without compromising inspection speed but some, such as steering and focusing, must still be performed at acquisition.Although ultrasonic arrays are now widely accepted in imaging systems, their full capability will only be realised when viewed as distributed data collection devices(2). The modular array hardware of DSL’s ‘FlawInspecta’ can now achieve this at real-time rates, significantly extending the post-processing operations that can be performed. These include steering and focusing adjustments, data-dependent adaptive focusing, and multi-array data collection and processing. A flexible data formatting has been devised to provide an interface for end-users to develop customised algorithms.The paper reports on the distributed data acquisition architecture and the data storage format. Specific post processing operations are covered elsewhere(3) but some typical options will be outlined.},

This paper discusses the selection of the appropriate mode and frequency range for different inspection requirements and reviews the possible methods of excitation, response measurement and signal processing. It is usually desirable to transmit a single, non-dispersive mode, and excitation methods to achieve this are discussed. A variety of signal processing techniques from simple time domain to relatively complex two-dimensional Fourier analysis are available. Time domain processing can often be applied satisfactorily in low frequency-thickness regions where only two modes can propagate, but tends to be unreliable above the cut-off frequency of the a1 mode. As an example of the design of a Lamb wave testing regime, a set of tests on a butt-welded steel plate with simulated weld defects of different depths is described. It is shown that by operating below the a1 cut-off frequency with judicious selection of testing technique, the presence of defects can be detected reliably from changes in the shape of the received waveform.},

To accomplish this task we have developed a 3D reflection tomography software (called jerry) that is designed to handle methods of realistic complexity and that is fast enough to allow practical 3D applications. We use a blocky representation of the subsurface with a B-Spline parametrization for interface geometries and for velocity distributions within layers. The forward problem of reflection tomography is formulated as a two-point ray tracing problem and is solved by a bending method based on Fermat's principle with an approximation of the actual ray geometry within a layer by a straight line. The C2 property of the model parametrization allows to calculate exact derivatives of the traveltime function with respect to the model and thus to calculate rays (trajectories that satisfy Fermat's principle) from initial trial trajectories. The trajectory initialization is based on Snell's law for transmission/reflection at interfaces and uses an iterative method to calculate the intersection point between straight rays and interfaces. The introduction of non-physical ghost interfaces allows to improve the ray path approximation and thus the accuracy of the calculated traveltimes.},

Nevertheless, some difficulties arise in presence of interfaces (i.e, wedges, immersion, etc.): refraction effects require computing the Snell\&apos;s law for every focus and element to find the fastest ray entry point in the interface. The process is easy but takes a long time. This work presents a new technique to compute the focusing delays for an equivalent virtual array that operates in the second medium only, thus avoiding any interface. It is nearly as fast as computing the focal laws in the homogeneous case and an order of magnitude faster than Snell\&apos;s or Fermat\&apos;s principle based methods. Furthermore, the technique is completely general and can be applied to any equipment having dynamic focusing capabilities. In fact, the technique is especially well suited for real-time focal law computing hardware.},

This technique consists in determining the position and shape of a convex object surface using a combination of synthetic transmit aperture (STA) and sign coherence factor (SCF) methods. The SCF attenuates the grating lobe noise. The technique is applied to a cylindrical aluminium object with internal holes simulating defects. The first step is the acquisition of a sequence of STA images with SCF, using a distinct group of adjacent array elements for each image. In the second step, a circle is fitted to the positions of the peak values in each image. Finally, using the Fermat\&apos;s principle and this circle as the interface between the water and the metallic object, the propagation delays from the array elements to the image grid points may be calculated and used in another STA image. In this final image, the small holes in the cylindrical object can clearly be identified. The effects of the SCF for a large diameter circular reflector are simulated and compared with experimental data.},

The study evaluates the validity and repeatability of these measurements and compares the findings with those obtained from instrumentation currently used in clinical practice.
Method: Measurements were taken on 52 subjects (104 eyes) aged 18–40 years with a range of mean spherical refractive error from +7.0 D to −9.50 D. IOLMaster measurements of anterior chamber depth and axial length were compared with A-scan applanation ultrasonography (Storz Omega) and those for corneal radius with a Javal-Schiötz keratometer (Topcon) and an EyeSys corneal videokeratoscope.
Results: Axial length: the difference between IOLMaster and ultrasound measures was insignificant (0.02 (SD 0.32) mm, p = 0.47) with no bias across the range sampled (22.40–27.99 mm). Anterior chamber depth: significantly shorter depths than ultrasound were found with the IOLMaster (−0.06 (0.25) mm, p {\textless}0.02) with no bias across the range sampled (2.85–4.40 mm). Corneal radius: IOLMaster measurements matched more closely those of the keratometer than those of the videokeratoscope (mean difference −0.03 v −0.06 mm respectively), but were more variable (95\% confidence 0.13 v 0.07 mm). The repeatability of all the above IOLMaster biometric measures was found to be of a high order with no significant bias across the measurement ranges sampled.
Conclusions: The validity and repeatability of measurements provided by the IOLMaster will augment future studies in ocular biometry.},

	abstract = {Different approaches have been extensively studied in order to obtain optimal focused beams through liquid-solid interfaces. In this paper, we compare two different focusing techniques: the standard Fermat's surface (FS) method and the time reversal (TR) approach. A FS transducer is designed such that the propagation times between the points on its surface and the desired focal point are equal. This method suffers from limitations, it needs the a priori knowledge of the geometry of the interface as well as the feature of the propagating medium. The TR method is based on the concept of time reversal of ultrasonic fields and takes into account the whole information coming from the sample. This technique is self adaptive and only requires the presence of a target in the solid sample, In this paper, we are interested in focusing an acoustic pressure field through a plane interface separating a liquid and a solid. Numerical and experimental results obtained with a 2D array are presented to compare the performances of the two techniques. These results demonstrate the ability of the TR technique to compensate automatically for the distortions induced by the interface},

	abstract = {This paper describes the use of a 550 (25times22) element 2 MHz 2D piezoelectric composite array in immersion mode to image an aluminum test block containing a collection of artificial defects. The defects included a 1 mm diameter side-drilled hole, a collection of 1 mm slot defects with varying degrees of skew to the normal and a flat bottomed hole. The data collection was carried out using the full matrix capture; a scanning procedure was developed to allow the operation of the large element count array through a conventional 64-channel phased array controller. A 3D TFM algorithm capable of imaging in a dual media environment was implemented in MATLAB for the offline processing the raw scan data. This algorithm facilitates the creation of 3D images of defects while accounting for refraction effects at material boundaries. In each of the test samples interrogated the defects, and their spatial position, are readily identified using TFM. Defect directional information has been characterized using VTFM for defect exhibiting angles up to and including 45deg of skew.},

	abstract = {The two main preconditions for the application of the Synthetic Aperture 
Focusing Technique (SAFT) are: (i) a large divergence of the sound beam
of the transducer and (ii) an exact knowledge about the sound
propagation path. These requirements are easily fulfilled for point
sources directly mounted on the surface of the specimen. In many cases,
however, the transducer is wedge mounted and/or coupled using a water
delay line, e.g. in immersion technique. These delay lines change the
beam index and the propagation path has to be evaluated for each pixel
separately considering Fermat's principle. Using phased array
transducers, a sector scan can improve the divergence of the sound beam.
The introduced method combines the advantages of using a phased array
transducer in immersion technique to improve SAFT reconstruction. An
algorithm is presented accounting the influence of the delay line on the
reconstruction method. The applicability of the algorithm is shown by
validation with simulated echo responses and with experimental results
collected from a specimen with artificial flaws.},

The algorithms are tested with simulated and experimental array data, each containing different noise levels. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in terms of lateral resolution and sensitivity to noise. It is shown that for the weak noise situation (SNR \&gt; 20 dB), time-reversal MUSIC provides significantly enhanced lateral resolution when compared to the total focusing method, breaking the diffraction limit. However, for higher noise levels, the total focusing method is shown to be robust, whilst the performance of time-reversal MUSIC is degraded. The influence of multiple scattering on the imaging algorithms is also investigated and shown to be small.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic arrays are increasingly widely used in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) due to their greater flexibility and potentially superior performance compared to conventional monolithic probes. The characterization of small defects remains a challenge for NDE and is of great importance for determining the impact of a defect on the integrity of a structure. In this paper, a technique for characterizing reflectors with subwavelength dimensions is described. This is achieved by post-processing the complete data set of time traces obtained from an ultrasonic array using two algorithms. The first algorithm is used to obtain information about reflector orientation and the second algorithm is used to distinguish between point-like reflectors that reflect uniformly in all directions and specular reflectors that have distinct orientations. Experimental results are presented using a commercial 64-element, 5-MHZ array on two aluminum test specimens that contain a number of machined slots and side-drilled holes. The results show that the orientation of 1-mm-long slots can be determined to within a few degrees and that the signals from 1-mm-long slots can be distinguished from that from a 1-mm-diameter circular hole. Techniques for quantifying both the orientation and the specularity of measured signals are presented and the effect of processing parameters on the accuracy of results is discussed.},

Trots, Comparison of sound fields generated by different coded excitations - Experimental results, Ultrasonics 44 (1) (2006) 121-129; J. Litniewski, A. Nowicki, Z. Klimonda, M. Lewandowski, Sound fields for coded excitations in water and tissue: experimental approach, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 33 (4) (2007) 601-607], which examined the factors influencing the spatial resolution of coded complementary Golay sequences (CGS), this paper investigates the effect of ultrasound imaging transducer's fractional bandwidth on the gain of the compressed echo signal for different spectral widths of the CGS. Two different bit lengths were considered, specifically one and two cycles. Three transducers having fractional bandwidth of 25\%, 58\% and 80\% and operating at frequencies 6, 4.4 and 6 MHz, respectively were examined (one of the 6 MHz sources was focused and made of composite material). The experimental results have shown that by increasing the code length, i.e. decreasing the bandwidth, the compressed echo amplitude could be enhanced. The smaller the bandwidth was the larger was the gain; the pulse-echo sensitivity of the echo amplitude increased by 1.88, 1.62 and 1.47, for 25\%, 58\% and 80\% bandwidths, respectively. These results indicate that two cycles bit length excitation is more suitable for use with bandwidth limited commercially available imaging transducers. Further, the time resolution is retained for transducers with two cycles excitation providing the fractional bandwidth is lower than approximately 90\%. The results of this work also show that adjusting the code length allows signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) to be enhanced while using limited (less that 80\%) bandwidth imaging transducers. Also, for such bandwidth limited transducers two cycles excitation would not decrease the time resolution, obtained with "conventional" spike excitation. Hence, CGS excitation could be successfully implemented with the existing, relatively narrow band imaging transducers without the need to use usually more expensive wideband, composite ones.},
